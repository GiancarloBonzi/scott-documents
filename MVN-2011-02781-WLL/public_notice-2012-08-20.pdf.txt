The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts,
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will
reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit
which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its
reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be
considered including the ctunulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics,
aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values,
flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation,
water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production,
mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the
people.

local agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and
evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit
for this proposal. To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered
species, historic properties, water quality, general enviromnental effects, and other public interest
factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or
an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments
are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the overall public interest
of the proposed activity.
A cultural resource, listed on the National Register (shipwreck), exists on the project site. The
applicant has proposed to cover the cultural resource with aggregate material and a top layer of clay
and surround with the proposed structure for protection of said resource. Copies of this notice are
being sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.

endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as
critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species.

Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would
result in the destruction or alteration of i acre(s) of EF H utilized by various life stages of red
drtun and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a
substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final
determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subj ect to review by
and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed Work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable Waters, the
evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed
activity Will not violate applicable Water quality standards Will be required from the Department of
Environmental Quality, Office of Environmental Services before a permit is issued.
