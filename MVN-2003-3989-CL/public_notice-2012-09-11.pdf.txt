family residential subdivision. The subdivision will include a driveway and green space for each lot, two
stormwater retention ponds with outfalls, 6 green space common areas, a sanitary sewer lift station and

retirement community with appurtenant facilities. Impacts to 3.3 acres of jurisdictional wetlands and 1.2 acres
of Others Waters of the U.S. were authorized. Wetland impacts were mitigated through the restoration of 3.7
acres of agricultural lands to bottomland hardwood forested wetlands.

Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including
cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the national
concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may be
expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors
which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those
are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and
wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion,
recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production,
mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Anny Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of
this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to
determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision,
comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general
environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of
an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine
the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The
possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific,
prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State
Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed Work would neither affect any species listed as endangered by the
U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and
recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFI-I) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-
Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or
alteration of n/a acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial
determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally
managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for
mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
lf the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation
of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable
water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, before a permit is
issued.

_3-
Any person may request, in Writing, Within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public
hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the
reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties Whom
you deem likely to have interest in the matter.
