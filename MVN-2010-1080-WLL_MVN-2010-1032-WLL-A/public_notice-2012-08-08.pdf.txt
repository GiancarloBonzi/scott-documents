EXPLANATORY NOTICE
The Regulatory Branch of the New Orleans District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, does
not routinely seek public comment on Decision Documents (Environmental Assessments)
prepared by the Branch as part of the agency’s deliberative process in making determinations
about the issuance or denial of Sec. 10 / Sec. 404 Regulatory Permits.
We have elected to make an exception to our normal practice and to solicit public
comment in the special case of Individual Permit No. MVN-20l0-1080-WLL, issued on an after-
the-fact basis to Mallard Basin, LLC on October 6, 2010, and Nationwide Permit No. 7, recorded
as MVN-201 0~l032-WLL, also approved for use on an after-the-fact basis by the same party on
July 6, 20l0.
Both permits have been challenged in United States Federal District Court for the
Western District of Louisiana by the Louisiana Crawfish Producers Association - West, et al.
As part of a special review process which the Government volunteered to undertake for the
purposes of ending this litigation, the New Orleans District hereby posts a revised Decision
Document incorporating new proj ect-related information and analyzing the impacts and effects
of the permitted activities upon the natural and human environment, in accordance with National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulatory guidelines and in accordance with our duties under
the Endangered Species Act (ESA).
The New Orleans District invites substantive comments from all interested parties during
this special 20-day public review process. _

MVN-2010-1032-WLL (Nationwide No. 7)
This document constitutes my Environmental Assessment, Statement of Findings
and review and compliance determination in accordance with the Section 404(b)(1)
Guidelines for the proposed project (proposed transfer permittee’s preferred alternative),
as described in the attached public notice.
I. Proposed Project: The location and description of the proposed project are detailed in
the attached public notice.
II. Environmental and Public Interest Factors Considered:
A. Purpose(s) and need(s) of permitted facilities:
(1) Overview of permittee’s purpose and need and the public interest:
After review of an after-the-fact permit application received from Mallard Basin, LLC in
2010, the Corps issued to the applicant an individual Department of the Army Sec. 404 (Permit
No. MVN-2010-01080-WLL) and found the applicant eligible for a Nationwide No. 7 permit,
thereby authorizing three facilities previously constructed or installed in waters of the United
States at the Fisher Bottom property. The Nationwide No. 7 permit authorized an electric water
pump and associated water intake and discharge pipe installed on the west bank of the Whiskey
Bay Pilot Channel in 2001 and the individual permit authorized restoration/ re-construction of
an approximately 1,900’ water conveyance ditch running from the electric pump to the northeast
end of the Fisher Bottom lake or impound area, and construction/ installation of a variable
crested aluminum water control structure and associated earthwork, installed in 1999 and
replacing one of two old wooden weirs.
Mallard Basin constructed these facilities, and sought authorization for their continued
use, for the purpose of improving the property owner’s ability to control and manipulate water
levels in the Fisher Bottom lake or water impoundment area. Mallard Basin, LLC was a limited
liability company formed by a group of individuals interested primarily in duck hunting and
wildlife enjoyment. The group obtained a water management plan from State of Louisiana
biologists designed principally to attract waterfowl to the Fisher Bottom lake. Scott Sebastien,
one of the Mallard Basin owners, explained the group’s purpose in a March 7, 2012 affidavit:
We contacted the Louisiana Department of Wildlife & Fisheries and invited an
experienced biologist named Robert Helm to the property to give us professional
guidance in aquatic wildlife and habitat management. He visited the property several

2
times after we completed the purchase to help us refine a successful wetland stewardship
program based on the expertise of the Department of Wildlife & Fisheries.
, (See Attachment 1: affidavit of Scott Sebastien, dated March 7, 2012).
The water management plan developed by the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and
Fisheries (LDWF) for Mallard Basin, LLC followed a general waterfowl habitat enhancement
approach known as “moist soil management” which emphasizes the necessity for active water
management in order to preserve the health of an aquatic habitat:
Effective management of wetlands for native moist soil vegetation in the Mississippi
Alluvial Valley provides abundant, high quality, food and cover for native game and non-
_ gamewildlife species in Louisiana. Many of these wetland wildlife species are of high
economic, recreational and conservation importance in the region. In order to effectively
manage land for moist soil vegetation, three things are necessary: 1. The ability to add and
remove water at specified times; 2. Means to manipulate vegetation in order to maintain
early successional species; and 3. A monitoring program of sufficient detail where specific
management actions can be evaluated and improved upon, based on the results.
(See Attachment ll, Management Plan for Fisher Bottom prepared by LDWF for Mallard
Basin, July 2010).
Under this program, Mallard Basin usually drained water from Fisher Bottom in early
August for a period of about three months to expose portions of the shallow water bottom and
allow native grasses and desirable emergent plant species to germinate and take root. Invasive
species like black willow, cattail, hyacinth, salvinia and alligator grass were cut back and
sometimes treated with herbicides. These draw-downs also helped to dry out dead organic
material on the water bottom, thereby minimizing the draw on dissolved oxygen in the water
column that decaying plant materials otherwise impose. When left umnanaged, submerged
accumulations of decaying invasive species like hyacinth and salvania can float up and create a
mat of dead vegetation called "'floton,” which cuts light penetration and contributes to hypoxia,
an indicator of an oxygen-starved water body and a common phenomenon in some parts of the
Atchafalaya Basin.
Mallard Basin usually restored water levels in Fisher Bottom in early November by
closing the water control structure and resuming pumping of water from the Pilot Channel until
the impound area returned to full pool. Mallard Basin maintained a high water level in Fisher
Bottom until the end of July ofthe following year. The higher water cycle prevented many
invasive species from germinating, thereby helping to control a portion of the managed area from
undesirable colonization by unwanted species.
This water management strategy was primarily designed to promote native emergent,
vegetative food sources, to eliminate non-native, opportunistic invasive species, and to attract
migratory waterfowl to Fisher Bottom in the fall, maximizing hunting opportunities for the
property’s owners. But the water management plan provides broader enviromnental benefits as
well. Following a joint site visit to Fisher Bottom on March 30, 2012, Paul Link, a biologist
with the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries who accompanied the Corps’ team and
who specializes in moist soil management projects, offered the following assessment of the
Fisher Bottom project:
In my opinion, the wildlife habitat was greatly improved via this proj ect’s activities.
Without the annual management and manipulation of the water control structures the area

3
that currently produces a multitude of beneficial seed-producing plants for waterfowl
would quickly be overtaken by less desirable species such as willow and Chinese tallow.
Further, the addition of the electric pump and conveyance ditch provides dependable
water to an area that historically flooded on a more routine basis prior to the construction
of the flood protection levees and straightening of the Atchafalaya River.”
(See Attachment III: email from Paul Link, LDWF, dated April 2, 20l2)
Because the moist soil management plan could not be effectively implemented without
the ability to lower water levels in the impoundment area and later to restore water levels at the
indicated months each year, Mallard Basin, LLC had a need for a water control structure capable
of maintaining variable levels of water in the impoundment area, as well as a water conveyance
system to bring water into Fisher Bottom when the moist soil management plan called for
restoring higher levels in the lake. The facilities Mallard Basin constructed fulfilled this need
and made the moist soil management plan possible. Replacement of the old wooden weirs with a
flap-gated aluminum water control structure had been recommended to Mallard Basin by LDWF
Waterfowl Biologists Robert Helm and Tony Vidrine. ln a March 20l0 letter Mr. Vidrine
reached conclusions similar to Paul Link’s findings:
_ _ . many undesirable plant species were invading this area and without repairs to the old
structures this area would be lost as desirable waterfowl habitat in the future. With the
_ ability to control water levels on this site, more desirable waterfowl plant foods would be
able to thrive on this site (see Attachment IV: letter dated March l5, 2010 from LDWF
signed by Tony Vidrine). _
Mallard Basin’s water management plan has measurable public interest benefits as well.
By promoting favorable habitat for waterfowl and encouraging diverse food sources, inevitably
other species are attracted to the area. Birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians benefit from the
projects’ available feeding, resting and nesting opportunities. From a human perspective,
preservation of a healthy intuidlated wetland enviromnent at Fisher Bottom is beneficial to the
broader health of the Atchafalaya Basin.
Mallard Basin improved the functionality of existing water management structures built
by previous owners of the Fisher Bottom property. As described in Section (2), below, an
original earthen embankment with two weirs and a water conveyance ditch were constructed on
the property sometime in the mid-twentieth century. Thus the historical record demonstrates that
prior owners of the property had an on-going need over more than fifty years to convey water
into Fisher Bottom by artificial means and to retain water in the impoundment area in order to
better nourish and maintain its inundated wetlands.
(2) Effects of historical navigation and flood control works on water circulation:
Navigation and flood control works built throughout the Atchafalaya Basin over the last
century have substantially altered natural water circulation patterns within the floodway. Some
areas have experienced increased flooding and a build-up of sediment deposits that have erased
numerous small lakes, depressions and ponds through the accretion of many feet of silt: “Since
l932, there has been a net accretion of nearly 2,500 million cubic meters of sediment in the
floodplain of the Lower Atchafalaya River Basin.” (Hale, L.F. 1997. Large-Scale Patterns and
Rates of Accretion in the Atchafalaya River Basin. Final Project Report submitted to USGS
cooperative extension, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA). Other areas of the basin,

4
including the area around Fisher Bottom, have seen a reduction in the levels of annual flooding.
The deepening of the main channel of the Atchafalaya River, excavation of the Whiskey
Bay Pilot Channel, and construction of levees and other flood control structures have reduced the
frequency and scale of seasonal flooding in areas surrounding the Fisher Bottom property
because the river now carries more water within its navigation channels during high water.
Excavated material placed along the banks of the Whiskey Bay Pilot Channel during major
dredging between 1934 and 1937 formed a significant man-made spoil ridge that now blocks
lesser flood-stage water flows from entering the adjacent wetlands (see Designing the Bayous,
The Control of Water in the Atchafalaya Basin, Martin Reuss, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
I998, p. 153). Mallard Basin noted in its permit application that as a consequence of these
navigation and flood control measures, Fisher Bottom no longer receives as much flood water,
leaving the project area drier than its historical norm and more vulnerable to overgrowth by
invasive shrub and tree species such as Black willow (Salix nigra) and Chinese tallow (Sapium
sebiferwn).
(3) Construction undertaken at project site by previous owners:
Prior to Mallard Basin’s purchase of the Fisher Bottom property in 1999, previous
owners constructed a 380’ long embankment approximately 20’ wide along the southeastern end
of the ponding area in order to better retain water and create a more permanent water impound.
They also installed two wooden weirs within this embankment to regulate water flows into
adjacent downstream areas. (The weirs were replaced with the variable crested water control
structure installed by Mallard Basin in 1999). These previous owners excavated the original
water conveyance ditch from the Whiskey Bay Pilot Channel in order to bring water into the
impoundment area, and installed a portable diesel pump along the channel to pump water into
Fisher Bottom.
After Mallard Basin purchased the property in 1999 the group hired a professor of Forestry at
LSU, Dr. Donald Reed, to take borings from two bald cypress trees and a red maple tree rooted
at the top of the embankment to estimate the age of the trees in order to ascertain an approximate
date when the embankment was put up. Dr. Reed determined that the trees had established
themselves atop the berm “well prior to the year 1960;” (see Attachment I-a, letter from Don
Reed, Professor of Forestry and Wildlife Specialist, LSU, dated April 5, 2010).1 Based on the
professor’s finding we conclude that the embankment and related infrastructure -the original
weirs and the water conveyance ditch - were most likely constructed before 1960 and before
enactment of the modern Clean Water Act in 1972. This historical activity falls within the
grandfathering provisions of the Clean Water Act and the Corps’ “unasserted jurisdiction
permit,” a broad nationwide permit granted by the agency for discharges of fill material in
jurisdictional wetlands occurring prior to 1975, as set forth in 33 CFR §330.3 “Activities
occurring before certain dates.”
(4) Mallard Basin’s construction and Water management activity:
1 We note that the administrative record contains several affidavits submitted through Leigh Haynie, former counsel
for the Louisiana Crawfish Producers Association - West, which attest that the affiants fished in Fisher Bottom
during the 1970s and 1980s and have no memory of a dike or water control structure at “Fisher Lake.” Without
contesting the truthfulness of these affidavits, the District finds the evidence presented by LSU professor Don Reed
in his April 5, 2010 letter to Mallard Basin conclusive that an earthen embankment existed at Fisher Bottom
sometime before 1960.

5
In 1999 Mallard Basin removed the original wooden weirs and recontoured the
embankment to create one outflow point, where it installed a water control structure across the
gap (see Photos 1 and 4). In 2001 Mallard Basin installed a permanent electric pump on a
separate parcel of its property along the Vfhiskey Bay Pilot channel (replacing the previous
owner’s portable diesel pump), and bored and installed a 40’ pipe to carry water from the new
pump through the channel’s high spoil bank and into the water conveyance ditch. Mallard Basin
then cleared and improved the old water conveyance ditch to carry Pilot Channel water about
1,900 feet and into the northern end of the Fisher Bottom containment area. Apparently some
portions of the old ditch were too heavily overgrown to restore so Mallard Basin instead dug new
sections of ditch to complete the system, mostly across non-jurisdictional uplands but including
some wetland areas, Its restored ditch measures approximately 2’ deep by 12’ wide.
Mallard Basin’s excavation work to improve water flow from the river channel into
Fisher Bottom involved the unpermitted sidecasting of approximately 4,062 cubic yards of
earthen material into jurisdictional wetlands (see Photos 21, 24, 25, 26). The excavated material
was used to improve about 380 feet of access trail and to strengthen and contour the
impoundment berm to accommodate the new water control structure. Approximately 9,083
cubic yards of additional material were excavated from non-jurisdictional wetlands and side-cast
onto adjacent non-wet areas during restoration of the portions of the conveyance ditch that
traverse upland property. All of the work in jurisdictional wetlands was completed by Mallard
Basin without a Department ofthe Army Sec. 404 permit, in violation of law.
_ After the New Orleans District received a complaint about Mallard Basin’s unauthorized
activity, the Surveillance & Enforcement Branch issued a Cease & Desist Order (C&D) to
Mallard Basin, LLC in March 2010. In May 2010 Mallard Basin submitted an after-the-fact
permit application, pursuant to 33 CFR 326.3(e), “Unauthorized activities - After-the-fact permit
applications.” The Corps subsequently authorized two permits to Mallard Basin, LLC: on July
6, 2010 we affirmed that the pump in the Whiskey Bay Pilot Channel qualified for a Nationwide
No. 7 permit (pursuant to Sec. 10 of the Rivers & Harbors Act) and on October 6, 2010 we
issued an individual Clean Water Act Sec. 404 after-the-fact permit, with conditions, forthe
water conveyance ditch and variable crested water control structure.
(5) New owner’s stated plans for Fisher Bottom property:
Mallard Basin sold the Fisher Bottom property in July 2011 to a new owner, Atchafalaya
Investments, LLC. In September 2011 Atchafalaya Investments submitted a written request to
the Corps to transfer the existing Mallard Basin permits into its name (see Attachment 2-a,
Atcahfalaya Investments, LLC letter, dated September 21, 2011). In its request for a transfer of
thepermits, Atchafalaya Investments expressed its intention to continue to manage Fisher
Bottom in compliance with the terms of the existing permit and to continue to follow Mallard
Basin’s moist soils management plan for the purpose of duck hunting as well as additional
private recreational uses, including deer hunting, frogging, fishing, crawfishing, bird watching,
alligator hunting, and general wildlife enjoyment by the property’s owners and invitees.
Atchafalaya Investments, LLC has expressed its intention to persist with the moist soil
management plan begun by Mallard Basin approximately twelve years ago, utilizing the pump,
water conveyance ditch and water control structure to maintain water within the Fisher Bottom
impoundment area (see Attachment I: affidavit of Scott Sebastien). The water management plan
appears to generally benefit the Atchafalaya Basin by safeguarding the health of Fisher Botto1n’s

6
forested wetland habitat, preserving good feeding sources for various species of fish, mammals,
reptiles and invertebrate aquatic life dependent upon shallow-water emergent and submerged
vegetation, and attracting waterfowl and other aquatic birds. Preservation of Fisher Bottom’s
inundated wetland also helps to offset the loss of this habitat type in other parts of the
Atchafalaya Basin while providing hunting and recreational opportunities for the property’s
owners, which is their stated primary interest.
B. Alternatives (33 CFR f520.4(a)(2), 40 CFR 230.10)
(1) No Action alternative:
The no action alternative would involve restoration of the project site to “pre-project”
conditions. Since we believe the original site work occurred sometime in the l950s, before the
Corps of Engineers acquired Clean Water Act jurisdiction over Sec. 404 wetlands, the scope of
the action under analysis in this Decision Document is limited to the work undertaken by
Mallard Basin during the present century, and excludes the pre-existing original earthen
embankment and water conveyance ditch.
If the District were to revoke the present permit and demand site restoration to “pre-
project conditions,” we would require the owner to suspend water management operations and to
remove the water ptunp and variable crested water control structure. We would not require those
portions of the water conveyance ditch between Fisher Bottom and the Whiskey Bay Pilot
Channel which were improved by Mallard Basin after 1999 and traverse jurisdictional wetlands
to be filled-in. These areas are now heavily vegetated and any action to attempt to re-deposit
soil material back into the shallow channel would cause umiecessary adverse impacts to these
wetlands. Furthermore the original conveyance ditch was excavated we believe more than fifty
years ago, and existed at the time Mallard Basin acquired the property. Thus abandomnent would
be the appropriate action with regard to the water conveyance ditch in order to best achieve pre-
project conditions.
In summary we define restoration of the site to pre-proj ect conditions under the “no
action plan” to require removal of the current water control structure, removal of the water intake
pipe and electric pump at the Whiskey Bay Pilot Channel, suspension of the existing water
management plan, and abandonment of the water conveyance ditch.
Implementation of the no action plan would substantially diminish Fisher Bottom’s water
retention capacity. Without a steady water source and with reduced storage capacity because of
the absence of a control structure, Fisher Bottom would hold less water throughout the year and
would tend to dry out more quickly when flood waters annually recede, leaving the site
significantly drier than it has been in recent decades. Floodwater levels in the Atchafalaya Basin
floodplain, which typically reach peak stages between March and April, (Soil Survey of Saint
Martin Parish, U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1977) may not be high enough to crest above the
Whiskey Bay Pilot Channel’s spoil bank to supply adequate water necessary to maintain the
current habitat conditions at Fisher Bottom, where the evidence shows that persistent levels of
water impoundment are important for habitat preservation.
During a site visit to Fisher Bottom on March 30, 2012, the Atchafalaya River measured
a flood-stage reading of l4 feet at the Butte LaRose gauge, but the surrounding forested _
floodplain was not inundated with water, even though spring flood season was approaching its

7
height. This is believed to be a result of the “severing effect” of the Whiskey Bay Pilot
Cham1el’s spoil bank on the historical flow of flood waters into the project area.
On the basis of this evidence we conclude that the No Action Alternative, requiring
removal of key features of the property’s water conveyance system, would end a hydrological
management regime that has prevailed at Fisher Bottom in various forms for over 5 0 years and
was designed to sustain a high-quality forested wetland environment. We conclude that this
would likely lead to a decline in the quality and health of the property’s inundated wetland
habitat that supports recreational fishing and hunting opportunities for the landowners and their
invitees, as well as for local crawfishermen who ply neighboring waters, because water
impoundment would diminish, shrinking the aquatic footprint and decreasing food sources at
Fisher Bottom, pressuring fish and wildlife communities now established at the site.
Colonization of the area by invasive plant species could also be hastened under the No Action
Alternative.
(2) Other project designs (smaller, larger, different etc.):
_ The maj or objective of the proposed action is to control annual water levels within the
700 acre Fisher Bottom inundated wetland in accordance with a professionally-designed
management plan intended to optimize a native swamp habitat and its diverse waterfowl, fish,
wildlife and other aquatic communities. The proj ect’s fixed infrastructure appears to have
sufficient flexibility to accommodate differing annual precipitation and floodwater conditions,
allowing for more water intake during dry years, while in wet years the flap- gated water control
structure may be gradually opened to better manage excess run-off. The existing system seems
capable of handling broad variances in natural conditions. We conclude that a “smaller” project
design would not occupy a significantly different footprint and would not offer a less damaging
practicable alternative because lesser pumping and lesser water storage capacity would more
likely make preservation of the present habitat more difficult. Similarly, the existing system’s
flexibility and apparent success in habitat management suggest no need for more infrastructure.
The current design is believed to be the most practical and beneficial option. Any
modification of the existing water management infrastructure would likely cause unnecessary
new impacts to jurisdictional wetlands without providing appreciable or needed benefits. We
find that the existing system, if operated in accordance with the proj ect’s water management
plan, appears to adequately sustain Fisher Bottom’s aquatic habitat by promoting desirable
vegetation and controlling invasive species.
(3) Other sites available to the applicant (40 CFR 230.10):
The water management infrastructure upgraded by Mallard Basin approximately a decade
ago has operated at Fisher Bottom for over 50 years in order to maintain a 600 acre forested
wetland habitat for the wildlife enjoyment and hunting opportunities of the property’s owners.
Utilization of other sites would not adequately meet the project’s private and public purposes.
Alternative sites within the Atchafalaya Basin for wetland recreation include Corps of
Engineers-managed boat launches and State-owned wildlife parks. But htmting is forbidden in
most of these public facilities and the private enjoyment of a wetland habitat would be
impossible at a public venue.
From a public-interest perspective, operation of the Fisher Bottom property in

8
conformance with the terms of the existing Sec. 404 permit offers an opportunity to secure
environmental protection of valuable wetland resources that might otherwise be degraded
through discontinuance of the present water management program. While similar inundated
wetlands have silted-in and been lost to other sections of the Atchafalaya Basin, the successful
management of Fisher Bottom as an inundated wetland would preserve its diversity of wildlife
and aquatic resources, through all stages of reproduction and growth, helping to sustain viable
populations of numerous foraging species. For example, the Black Crowned Night
Heron (Nycticorax nycticorax) utilizes Fisher Bottom for its rookeries, dispersing into other
parts of the Atchafalaya Basin after nesting season.
‘ (4) Other sites not available to the applicant. See (3) above.
C. Physical/chemical characteristics and anticipated changes (check applicable blocks
and provide concise description of impacts):
(X) Substrate. Soils within the proposed project area have been identified as
unconsolidated sediments, including spoil from the Whiskey Bay Pilot Channel, Convent Soils,
frequently flooded (C O) and Fausse Soils (F5). According to the United States Department of
Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service, CO soils are listed as frequently flooded and are subject
to scouring and deposition with an elevation range from about l4 to 26 feet above sea level.
Some areas within Fisher Bottom follow a ridge and swale pattern. Typically C O soils have a
surface layer of silt loam about 4-inches thick on top of a layer of very fine sandy loam. CO
soils are high in fertility. Wate;r and air move at a moderate rate through these soils.
FS soils occur in large tracts of swamp on the alluvial plain inside the Atchafalaya Basin
Floodway. They are subject to annual flooding by the Atchafalaya River. Typically, Fausse
soils are are a dark, mucky clay about 7-inches deep followed by layers of clay. The water table
usually settles between 0.5 above the surface to 1.5 feet below the surface throughout the year.
FS soils are high in fertility. Air and water move very slowly through them.
Minor adverse effects to the substrate, including disruption of profiles in dredged areas
and compaction in areas where spoil material was placed in wetlands, may have occurred when
excavation work took place more than a decade ago. But no long term adverse impacts to the
local aquatic ecosystem are evident. Site investigations show that spoil placement areas are
minimal in size and possess hydric characteristics and functions that support wetland
communities. Spoil placement areas are now relatively flat and are vegetated with wetland plant
species. During a field site visit on March 30, 2012, typical native wetland plant species were
observed in these areas, including buttonbush (Cephalanthus occidentalis) and Arkansas
mannagrass (Glyceria arkansana); (see attachment V: photos 5, 7, 8, 9, 10).
(X) Currents, circulation or drainage patterns. Surface and subsurface project
hydrology is greatly affected by seasonal flooding cycles of the Atchafalaya River. The river
level generally rises in late November and peaks in March and April. Rising floodwaters can
inundate much of the project area and are unaffected by project structures. But during low water
periods in the river, circulation within the project area depends on rainfall and mechanical
pumping from the river. Areas where excavated material was placed by Mallard Basin about a
decade ago now present little to no increase in elevation over natural ground contours and are not
anticipated to impede sheet flow.

9
Since water levels in the impound area would diminish to a few small pools during low
water periods in the river without augmentation through pumping of water from the Pilot
Channel, the proj ect’s water conveyance and management system provides a needed water
supply to preserve the aquatic enviromnent of Fisher Bottom. During high flood cycles when the
river reaches 18- feet flood stage at the Butte LaRose gauge project structures would be
submerged and would not impede floodwater circulation patterns.
During the March 30, 2012 site visit, the Atchafalaya River registered 14.1 feet
elevation at the Butte LaRose gauge; (see attachment V1: Butte LaRose Gauge data for March 1-
2, 2012 ; rivergaugescom). At that stage, the forested areas in and surrounding the project area
contained no floodwaters. But backwater flows from Warner Lake had substantially raised
levels in the Fisher Bottom area over target management goals and excess water was being
released through the flap~gated water control structure (see Attachment V: photos l, 4).
Water levels at Fisher Bottom are controlled through a conveyance ditch that delivers
water drawn from the Whiskey Bay Pilot Channel by an electric ptunp through an intake pipe.
Much of the conveyance ditch was constructed through non-wet habitat (see Attachment V:
Photos 2, 3, 6, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26). A portion of the conveyance ditch was dredged through
wetlands, with the spoil spread along its banks. This work occurred approximately 10 years ago
and today little to no adverse impact to natural contour elevations is evident. The areas where
spoil was broadcast now support vegetative commtuiities typical of local forested wetlands (see
Attachment V: photos 5, 7, 8, 9, 10). ,
(X) Suspended particulates; turbidity. Wetlands and submerged aquatic vegetation
communities on the project site ftuiction to filter and remove suspended particulates from
localized stonn water runoff and/or floodwaters passing through them. Reduced turbidity is a
benefit of the proj ect’s wetlands and promotes the growth of submerged aquatic vegetation.
(X) Water quality (temperature, salinity patterns and other parameters). Project
wetlands provide flood storage capacity that enhances water quality through sediment/toxicant
retention, nutrient removal/transformation, and ground water recharge. The water budget for the
site is dominated by the annual flood cycles of the Atchafalaya River and secondarily by
precipitation, and/or mechanical pumping. In 2010 the State determined that the water
management program at Fisher Bottom met Louisiana water quality standards and issued the
then property owner, Mallard Basin, LLC, water quality certification on August 19, 2010
(WQC1005 1 8-03/ A1170878/ CER20l0000l). ln a document titled “Rationale for Decision,”
dated October 18, 2010, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality made the following
comments:
Based on a careful review and evaluation of the entire administrative record, including
the public comments, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, Office of
Enviromnental Services, finds that Mallard Basin’s project, as proposed in the application
for a water quality certification, will not violate the water quality standards of Louisiana.
As previously described, the presence of high quality swamp and moist soil habitat
provides a natural filter for water-borne sediments and pollutants, thereby improving water
quality.
(X) Flood control functions. Annual flooding at the project site is a natural occurrence

10
in the Atchafalaya Basin, despite significant changes in floodwater circulation caused by human
activity during the last century, as discussed above. We do not anticipate that the project’s
water management regime will adversely affect regional flood control functions. On the
contrary, annual flooding of the Atchafalaya River and its floodplain is likely to inundate the
project site with floodwaters when the river reaches levels of +17-l 8 feet elevation at the Butte
LaRose gauge. The improved water impoundment capacity of Fisher Bottom due to project
features serves to retard floodwater run-off and to enhance the property’s inundated wetland
habitat.
(X) Storm, Wave and erosion buffers. The Fisher Bottom water management plan
appears to encourage and enhance growth of native wetlands species which act to reduce erosion
of surface soils during precipitation runoff and /or flood conditions.
(X) Erosion and accretion patterns. The project site is relatively isolated from much
of the river’s natural flood waters due to the elevated spoil bank along the western bank of the
Whiskey Bay Pilot Channel. While depriving the project site of some floodwaters that otherwise
would have reached Fisher Bottom during flood season, the spoil bank has protected the site
from the accretion of sediments that characterizes many other areas of the basin, a consequence
of the high sediment load in Atchafalaya River floodwaters. The fact that Fisher Bottom has not
filled in during the last 50 years is evidence that accretion is not a major problem at the site.
The Fisher Bottom water management infrastructure would have little to no discernable impact
on accretion patterns associated with annual overbank flooding from the Atchafalaya River.
(X) Aquifer recharge. Maintenance of approximately 600 acres of flooded swamp and
bottomland hardwoods could provide benefits to the aquifer through the availability of a more
permanent surface water pool.
` (X) Baseflow. Mallard Basin’s work to improve the water conveyance ditch and to
update the water control structure with the use of heavy equipment may have temporarily
compacted surface soils. Reduced water permeability in compacted soils could restrict
groundwater flow, but observations made during visits to the project site and a jurisdictional
determination performed by Corps biologists showed no indications of adverse impacts to base
flow. As indicated previously, the work areas have re-vegetated and continue to function as part
of the wetland ecosystem.
(X) Other. N/A
Additionally, for projects involving the discharge of dredged material:
(X) Mixing zone, in light of the depth of water at the disposal site; current velocity,
direction and variability at the disposal site; degree of turbulence; water column
stratification; discharge vessel speed and direction; rate of discharge; dredged material
characteristics; number of discharges per unit of time; and any other relevant factors
affecting rates and patterns of mixing. The project site experiences minimal current, if any,
except during periods of active flooding. Natural topography, density of tree growth and
emergent vegetation influence currents and circulation patterns which, in turn, affect the mixing

ll
zone. During flood stages in the Atchafalaya River, when floodwaters reach elevations capable
of inundating the project site, the current velocity, patterns of mixing and discharge rates of
sediment load will follow ambient conditions in the surrounding, inundated floodplain.
`D. Biological characteristics and anticipated changes (check applicable blocks and
provide concise description of impacts):
(X) Special aquatic sites (wetlands, mudflats, coral reefs, pool and riffle areas,
vegetated shallows, sanctuaries and refuges, as defined in 40 CFR 230.40-45). Construction
of the project is believed to have caused temporary impacts to approximately 0.9 acres of
jurisdictional swamp wetlands. But project area wetlands today show no persistent damage from
spoil placement a decade ago and are considered high quality due to the maturity and diversity of
the swamp habitat. Tree species associated with swamp wetlands found throughout the project
site include Bald Cypress (T czxodium disrichium), Drummond’s red maple (Acer rubrum var.
drummondii), Black willow (Salix nigra), and Tupelo Gtun (Nyssa Aquatica). Project area
wetlands provide resting, nesting, feeding, and breeding habitat for many avian species, such as
raptors, woodpeckers, wood ducks, migratory waterfowl and songbirds. Mammals like raccoon,
eastern cottontail, deer, opossum, armadillo, and gray squirrel are also dependent on the project
habitat. Artificial pumping of water into the proj ect’s inundated wetlands along the water
conveyance ditch offsets the interruption to floodwater flows in the area caused by spoil
placement along the Whiskey Bay Pilot Channel.
If the Fisher Bottom water conveyance infrastructure were removed and the owner’s
management plan suspended, healthy and productive native habitat would likely diminish in
quality as undesirable vegetative species find greater opportunities to establish themselves and
upset the native balance.
As stated above, the property’s new owners have advised the New Orleans District of their
intention to manage the project in conformance with water management recommendations
provided to the previous owner by waterfowl biologists from the Louisiana Department of
Wildlife and Fisheries. Waterfowl biologists from the LDWF accompanied Corps personnel
during the project site visit on March 30, 2012 to assess the health of the property’s aquatic
habitats and the effects of the ongoing management plan. LDWF found the site to be in excellent
condition, exhibiting characteristics of a successfully managed moist soil area and after the site
visit their biologists expressed the view that removal of the water conveyance and control
structures would promote an invasion of noxious plant species in the project area and would
diminish many of the benefits the proj ect’s water conveyance and storage infrastructure now
provides (see Attachment III: email from Paul Link, LDWF, dated April 2, 2012).
(X) Habitat for fish and other aquatic organisms. Wetlands within the project area
experience an annual cycle of rising and receding flood waters. Many species, including aquatic
invertebrates and amphibians, find these areas excellent habitat due to the seasonal shallow cover
provided by aquatic vegetation which protects eggs and larval stages from predation by fish and
birds. Preventing noxious invasive species from choking out this more desirable emergent
vegetation also helps to maintain larger open water areas important to aquatic species during
mature phases of their life cycle. Crawfish populations will benefit from the higher water levels

12
usually retained in Fisher Bottom during periods of dry conditions, when habitat outside the
project area may lose standing water.
The periodic draw-downs of water required for proper moist soil management mimic the
natural drying cycle and allow some of the vegetative substrate to release seeds and nutrients into
the soil, which encourages the germination of another cycle of emergent vegetation. Early
summer draw-downs also concentrate invertebrates in remaining pools, providing optimum
feeding habitat for young waterfowl, shorebirds and herons.
(X) Wildlife habitat (breeding, cover, food, travel, general). The forested wetlands of
Fisher Bottom provide wildlife habitat for a variety of mammals, birds, mammals, reptiles and
amphibians. These species utilize the property’s inundated wetlands habitat for feeding, nesting,
and resting. Moist soil management promotes the growth of beneficial native emergent plant
species which birds and waterfowl use as a food source. Maintained water levels are beneficial
to migratory waterfowl. The presence of open areas free from woody growth, and shallow water
with a healthy crop of seed-bearing vegetation in the Fall of the year, are highly sought after by
migratory waterfowl and other migrating birds common to the South Louisiana flyway.
Maintenance of this habitat mix is the expressed goal of the Fisher Bottom management plan,
achieved through the continued operation of the property’s water conveyance and impotuidment
infrastructure.
(X) Endangered or threatened species. We evaluated the potential effects of the
project on all species listed as endangered or threatened, pursuant to the Endangered Species Act
(ESA), that have designated habitat in the area of Fisher Bottom. We have also evaluated the
potential effects of the project on any endangered or threatened species for which there is a
reasonable chance that individuals of the species could occupy or travel through the Fisher
Bottom property. We have concluded that one threatened species, the Louisiana black bear, is
potentially active in the proj ect area. The Fisher Bottom property is located inside the
boundaries of the bear’s designated critical habitat. We also recognize that the comment letter
submitted by Ms. Leigh Haynie on Jtuie 4, 2010, then counsel for the Atchafalaya Basinkeeper,
and received in response to our original request for public comment, included expressions of
concern about potential adverse project impacts to three other species: the peregrine falcon, the
Florida panther and the Ivory-billed woodpecker.
While the peregrine falcon receives certain protections under the Migratory Bird Treaty
Act (MBTA), the falcon is not an ESA-listed species. The falcon’s range may extend to areas
within the Atchafalaya Basin that include,Fisher Bottom. Accordingly, the possibility exists that
a hunter on the Fisher Bottom property could shoot a peregrine falcon. But the species typically
nests on cliffs and high rock ledges, physical features that do not exist in the Atchafalaya Basin,
if anywhere in Louisiana. Consequently we believe that the Fisher Bottom project does not
present a significant threat to the peregrine falcon. If a falcon were shot without proper
permitting Luider the MBTA, the federal government could bring an enforcement action against
the hunter.
The Florida panther is an ESA-listed endangered species with a range identified by the
U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS) to primarily cover 16 counties in the State of Florida,
where the panther is the official state mammal. Wildlife biologists estimate the total population
of the species to be under 100 individuals. To our knowledge no recent verified sightings of the

13
Florida panther have been made in the Atchafalaya Basin.
The Ivory-billed woodpecker is an ESA-listed endangered species believed by the
USFWS to possibly inhabit the Big Woods region of eastern Arkansas, though its historic range
probably included the Atchafalaya Basin and the Pearl River basin in eastern Louisiana.
Scientific controversyover recent sightings of the Ivory-billed woodpecker continues, with
several well-regarded teams of biologists claiming that the species has gone extinct. (See
Conservation Biology, February 2012 issue, “Uncertain Sightings and the Extinction of the
Ivory-Billed Woodpecker.”) The most acclaimed Ivory-billed woodpecker expert, the
ornitholo gist Dr. James Tanner, estimated that by the late 1930s the total population of the
species did not exceed 22 individuals.
During various site visits to the Fisher Bottom property, involving close observation of
surface, understory and canopy foliage and features, the Corps’ biologists encountered no signs
of the Peregrine falcon, Florida panther or the Ivory-billed woodpecker. And silence at the
regional level about the possible presence of the Florida panther or Ivory-billed woodpecker in
the'Basin affirms our field observations at Fisher Bottom. The New Orleans District processes
numerous regulatory actions throughout the Atchafalaya Basin each year, often in close
coordination with the USFWS, the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, and the
Environmental Protection Agency; during these consultations over regulated activities none of
the agencies has reported any evidence of the Florida panther or the Ivory-billed woodpecker
within Atchafalaya Basin habitat.
The rarity of these animals, and the absence of reliable contemporary sightings near the
project area, lead us to conclude that the likelihood of the presence of individual Florida panthers
or Ivory-billed woodpeckers at or near Fisher Bottom is negligible.
The possibility that the Louisiana black bear may utilize Fisher Bottom habitat is higher,
though we have not yet seen evidence of the bear on the property. Fisher Bottom’s forested
wetland swamp is designated critical habitat for the Louisiana black bear (Ursus Americanus
Luteolus). The project site is located within the boundaries of Unit 2 of Critical Habitat for the
endangered Louisiana black bear.
` During the processing of Mallard Basin’s after-the-fact permit application, the Corps
anticipated receiving comments about potential project effects on the Louisiana black bear from
the USFWS, after we posted a request for public comment on May 24, 2010. The Service did
not comment. In the context of this re-evaluation of the Mallard Basin permits we wrote the
USFWS on February 2, 2011 to specifically request consultation on endangered and threatened
species; (see Attachment VII-a: letter from USACE New Orleans District to U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service date February 2, 2011). The Service responded by letter on February 28, 2012,
explaining that it has established a policy by which it declines to comment on all Department of
the Army “after-the-fact” permit applications; (see Attachment VII: letter from USFWS to New
Orleans District, dated February 28, 2012). We will re-contact the USFWS and again seek its
opinion during the public comment period for this draft Decision Document.
Because we were unable to obtain guidance from the USFWS, the District sought
assistance from State experts on the Louisiana black bear in order to reach a better-informed
determination of the Fisher Bottom proj ect’s possible effects on the Louisiana black bear. The
Corps obtained the assistance of Louisiana biologists and black bear experts Paul Davidson,

14
chairman of the Black Bear Conservation Coalition, and Maria Davidson, Large Carnivore
Program Manager for the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries. Both participated in
the Corps’ Fisher Bottom field visit on March 30, 2012.
On March 30, 2012 Paul Davidson and Maria Davidson toured the Fisher Bottom site, in
the company of LDWF waterfowl management experts Paul Link and Jason Olzsac, the Corps’
enviromnental resource specialists Ronnie Duke and Michael Herrmann, Botanist/ Agent for
Mallard Basin Tim Morton, a Mallard Basin partner and previous owner of the property, Mr.
Scott Sebastien, and a partner in Atchafalaya Investments, LLC, Dr. William Schumacher, recent
purchaser of the property. The parties observed all of the projects’ features discussed in this
Decision Document. Both Paul Davidson and Maria Davidson studied several sections of the
water conveyance ditch, paying particular attention to the forested habitat and spoil placement
areas along the conveyance ditch. Observations were also made of the electric pump and intake
pipe at the Whiskey Bay Pilot Channel, the flap-gated water control structure at the lower end of
the water impoundment area, and various sections of the property’s open-water inundated swamp
/ moist soil management area. '
~ Paul Davidson provided follow-up comments to the Corps in a letter dated April 10,
2012. His letter contains the following observations:
On March 30, 2012, l accompanied Corps personnel, LA Dept. of Wildlife and Fisheries
personnel, and the current and previous landowner to a site on the west side of the
Whiskey Bay Pilot Channel, just south of Interstate 10 in St. Martin Parish. The purpose
of the site visit was to assess the impacts of a water impoundment on the federally listed
(ESA) Louisiana black bear (Ursus americanus luteolus).
_ We looked at the water control structure, pump and water distribution system, a
boathouse and toured the impoundment. The water level in the unit was being lowered,
so water was running out of the water control structure, attracting a lot of activity from
fish in the outflow.
The basic habitat needs for black bears include abundant and diverse natural foods, water,
escape cover, dispersal corridors, and den sites. I saw nothing at any of the sites that
would be anything but good for a black bear. Soft mast, primarily blackberry, was
abundant, and the area was densely vegetated, providing excellent cover for bears and
any other wild fauna th.at might be found there. Everything that l saw was excellent
bottomland hardwood habitat for bears and nothing associated with the water control
structure or pump and piping could be described as detrimental to bears or bear habitat.
Areas to the south of the site are likely too wet to provide good habitat for bears, but the
Mallard Basin site, albeit void of bears at present, will likely attract bears as the bear
population in the region continues to increase.”
(See Attachment IX: letter from Paul Davidson, Executive Director, Black Bear
Conservation Coalition, dated April 12, 2012).
Maria Davidson noted during the field trip that the Fisher Bottom site is not known to
be a black bear breeding area, or to have a current population of black bears. After the site visit,
the LDWF Large Carnivore Section provided the following comments by letter dated May 2,
20 12:
The professional staff of the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF)
Large Carnivore Section has reviewed the above listed project. Based upon this

15
review, and a field visit on March 30, 2012; we have found the project has no
impact to the Louisiana black bear and have no objection to this project.
c (See Attachment X: letter from LDWF Large Carnivore Section to Pete Serio,
Chief, Regulatory Branch, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers New Orleans District,
dated May 2, 2012).
During the site inspection the Corps’ Regulatory Branch biologists, Michael Herrmann
and Ronnie Duke, examined the project infrastructure, taking note of the condition and quality of
the Fisher Bottom habitat from the perspective of potential black bear inhabitants or visitors, as
well as other species. The inundated wetlands appeared healthy, with a variety of freshwater
emergent plant species present. The open water areas were fringed with mature clusters of Bald
Cypress trees, occasional Black; Willow and Red Maple trees, as well as stands of emergent
vegetation such as Smartweed, Arkansas mannagrass and Walteri millet. Submerged aquatic
vegetation, including coontail and milfoil, populated the shallow water flats.
While traveling around the site by boat, several alligators were observed along with
small groups of Blue Winged Teal, Wood Ducks, Yellow Crowned Night Herons, Great Blue
Herons and Glossy Ibis. Several individual crawfish were spooked from the shallow shore lines
and retreated into deeper water.. The impoundment area extends to a stand of flooded cypress
and also includes shallow open water areas. It appeared to be excellent habitat for waterfowl and
wading birds. The former landowner, Scott Sebastien, informed us that Fisher Bottom has
become a rookery for multiple species of herons and ibis.
Throughout the site visit, Duke and Herrmann had the opportunity to observe the
bottomland hardwoods surrotuiding the impoundment from various vantage points, as well as the
conveyance ditch connecting the Whiskey Bay Pilot Channel to the inundated swamp. The
habitat includes a mix of healthy, mature hardwoods. While they found no black bear den trees
and no evidence of any individual black bears, they also saw no evidence of any detriment or
harm to black bear habitat within the project area. Instead Fisher Bottom shows a consistently
healthy native ecosystem that could provide good forage opportunities for the black bear.
In consideration of our observations during the March 30, 20l2 site visit, and the
comments received from the State’s black bear experts who have years of professional
experience dedicated to the Louisiana black bear and its habitat, the Corps determines that the
above permitted activities -in particular, operation of Fisher Basin’s existing water control
structure , water pump and water conveyance ditch in conformance with the moist soil
management plan made part ofthe Sec. 404 individual permit - may affect, but are not likely to
adversely affect, the Louisiana black bear or its habitat.
On the basis of our findings specific to the Louisiana black bear, the District concludes
that transfer of the existing permits to the property’s new owner, Atchafalaya Investments, LLC,
and Atchafalaya Investment’s continued operation of the water control and water conveyance
facilities constructed by Mallard Basin, LLC in accordance with the existing water management
plan, as well as the new owner’s conduct of additional activities at Fisher Bottom as proposed in
Atchafalaya Investments’ written request for a transfer of the existing permits, including deer
hunting, frogging, fishing, crawfishing, bird watching, alligator hunting, and general wildlife
enjoyment, may affect, but are not likely to adversely affect, the Louisiana black bear.
Separately we find that the project will have no effect on other listed species, in particular

16
the Ivory-billed Woodpecker and the Florida panther. We reach this conclusion after due
consideration of the scientific literature and the absence of any reliable contemporary sightings
of these species near the project area. The Corps processes numerous regulatory actions in the
Atchafalaya Basin each year, in close coordination with the USFWS, the Environmental
Protection Agency, and State resource agencies, in particular the Louisiana Department of
Wildlife and Fisheries. No evidence of the presence of the Ivory-billed Woodpecker or the
Florida panther has come to our attention through our on- going coordination with fellow
agencies.
Moreover, considerable debate persists among ornithologists over the validity of alleged
sightings of individual Ivory-billed Woodpeckers during the last decade near the White River
National Wildlife Refuge inthe “Big Woods” region of eastern Arkansas, along the Mississippi
River. In any case this area is approximately 300 miles north of the Fisher Bottom project site
and We conclude that the possibility Ivory~billed Woodpeckers may inhabit or utilize Fisher
Bottom habitat is statistically de minimis. Similarly, the Florida panther is believed by USFWS
biologists to inhabit areas of southern Florida near Lake Okeechobee, more than 800 miles east
of the Fisher Bottom region of the Atchafalaya Basin. While reports of recent sightings of big
cats in the Atchafalaya Basin have been made, the evidence indicates that these animals are
cougars, not Florida panthers. We conclude that the likelihood of finding Florida panthers in the
project area is near zero.
(X) Biological availability of possible contaminants in dredged or fill material,
considering hydrography in relation to testing of material from the vicinity of the project;
known significant sources of persistent pesticides from land runoff or percolation; spill
records for petroleum products or designated (Section 311 of the CWA) hazardous
substances; other public records of significant introduction of contaminants from
industries, municipalities or other sources. The soil excavated during Mallard Basin’s
ditching improvement Work a decade ago is not believed to have carried any significant levels of
contaminants. Proj ect construction may have introduced de minimis levels of contaminants such
as particulates from vehicle emissions, oils, radiator fluids, and rubber. If so, it is probable that
any such contaminants Were quickly diluted with no detectable, harmful concentrations. The
project site vegetation would act to filter out contaminants from Waters flowing through the area.
No indications of significant impacts to water quality are evident at the project site, as reflected
by the Louisiana Department of Enviromnental Quality’s issuance of a Water quality certificate
forthe project on August 9, 2010.
(X) or-her. N/A
E. Human use characteristics and impacts (check applicable blocks and provide concise
description of impacts):
(X) Existing and potential water supplies; Water conservation. Water for use under
the_proj ect’s Water management plan is expected to come primarily from the Whiskey Bay Pilot
Chamiel. We believe that Water usage rates consistent with the proj ect’s Water management plan
Would not affect the availability or delivery of Water from the river to municipal systems
dependent on the Atchafalaya River.
(X) Recreational or commercial fisheries. Management of Fisher Bottoms provides

17
water on site during periods of dry conditions. The availability of habitat with food and
protective cover should contribute to overall populations of crawfish, which are free to migrate
in and out of the project area. During periods of temporary water level draw-down, Fisher
Bottom would continue to retain significant pools of water in the lowest contours of the site,
where aquatic species may shelter. Thus the water management plan is expected to provide
habitat that supports various fish species as well as the highly sought-after red swamp crawfish,
all of which may benefit recreational and commercial interests.
(X) Other water-related recreation. The objective of the project’s water management
plan is to maintain a high quality inundated wetland habitat that supports an abundance of
wildlife, including fish and game species of recreational interest to the property’s owners, who
have indicated by letter to the Corps their interest in deer and alligator hunting, waterfowl
hunting, frogging, crawfishing, fishing, canoeing, and bird watching.
(X) Aesthetics of the aquatic ecosystem. Spoil placement areas and conveyance ditches
where Mallard Basin undertook excavation work during project construction a decade ago have
hilly re-vegetated, blending in with adjacent, unaffected woodlands. The water control structure
interjects a mechanical facility within the project area’s natural setting, but it is relatively hidden
within the forest canopy. The electric pump is screened by scrub and its operation is significantly
quieter than the prior owner’s diesel pump. Aesthetic values benefit from the protection of a
mature cypress swamp habitat preserved within the proj ect’s impounded moist soil management
area.
Photographs of the Fisher Bottom impoundment area were taken during the March 30,
2012 site visit to provide visual evidence of the current aesthetics of the managed site (see
photographs of Fisher Bottom impoundment area Attachment V: photos l-30, by Michael
Herrmann, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New Orleans District).
` (X) Parks, national and historic monuments, national seashores, wild and scenic
rivers, wilderness areas, research sites, etc. The project site is near the Atchafalaya National
Wildlife Refuge and the Indian Bayou Wildlife Management Area. These publicly-owned
recreational areas are utilized by hunters, anglers, birdwatchers, boaters and those interested in
nature. We believe the potential benefits of the Fisher Bottom water management plan to protect
the health of the inmidated Cypress-Tupelo swamp and bottomland hardwoods on the property
will positively compliment these adjacent public habitats.
(X) Traffic/transportation patterns. Local traffic will not be significantly affected by
the property owners’ and their invitees’ use of Fisher Bottom because the site is isolated and
accessible primarily by boat.
(X) Energy consumption or generation. Gasoline for boats and ATVs may be
consumed on the property by the permittee and his guests during recreational outings. There are
no proposed actions for the exploration and/or production of energy on the project site.
(X) Navigation. The project site is not situated in an area used or accessible for general
navigation, except during extreme high flood stages in the Atchafalaya River. During such
periods of high water, navigation may be possible throughout the area despite the project’s

18
structures. No significant impediment to navigation on public waters will be caused by
continued operation of the proj ect’s water management infrastructure.
Comments received by the Corps during the 20 day public notice period after publication
of Mallard Basin’s permit application included expressions of concern that the proj ect’s water
control structure blocks navigation and prohibits crawfishermen and boaters from entering Fisher
Bottom. But during multiple site visits to Fisher Bottom the District’s biologists observed a
wooded floodplain below the water control structure, where a shallow ephemeral channel
diffuses into a forested area. Navigation across this water discharge area would be impossible
even by the shallowest of watercraft during most of the year. During the March 30, 2012 field
investigation to the site, Scott Sebastien, Curtis Robin and William Schumacher stated that the
Atchafalaya River must reach a flood stage of 17 to 18-feet elevation or higher at the Butte
LaRose gauge for backwater flooding to allow navigation into Fisher Bottom. During such
flood stages the project site is accessible from multiple locations, and bypassing of the water
control structure is possible. During the March 30, 2012 site visit the Butte LaRose gauge
measured 14.1 feet and flooding of the area was not evident.
(X) Safety. Boating access to the Fisher Bottom site during non-flood conditions is
effectively impossible and attempts to reach the property by watercraft would be unsafe and
llI1W1S€ .
` (X) Air quality. The project has been analyzed for conformity with regulations
implementing Section 176(c) of the Clean Air Act. The activities allowed under the existing
project permit do not exceed ale minimis levels of direct emissions of any criteria pollutant or its
precursors and are exempted by 40 CFR Part 93.153. Any later indirect emissions are generally
not within the Corps’ continuing program responsibility and generally cannot be practicably
controlled by the Corps. For these reasons a conformity determination is not required for this
project.
l (X) Noise. Utilization of ATVs and watercraft, as well as hunting, fishing and water
management activities may present an increase in ambient noise levels. However, elevated
noise levels associated with project usage would be periodic and of short duration, with no
anticipated serious long-term impacts to the local biological or human environments.
(X) Cultural resources. The State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) was forwarded
a copy of the original public notice prior to issuance of this permit. No comments were received
from the SHPO in response to the public notice. During several site visits, Corps personnel found
no evidence of historic or archaeological structures or artifacts at the Fisher Bottom property.
We conclude that the project has not negatively impacted any known cultural resources. A
condition (General Condition No. 3) is contained in all Department of the Army permits that
requires the permittee to notify the District office if previously unknown historic or
archaeological remains are discovered. Such notification would initiate coordination with the
appropriate State and/ or Federal agencies to determine if the remains warrant a recovery effort,
or if the site is eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.
(X) Land use classification. The Fisher Bottom tract is classified as a Cypress-Tupelo
swamp and bottomland hardwood habitat, similar to much of the land mass Within the

19
Atchafalaya floodway. The present property owners are seeking a transfer of the existing DA
permit in order to retain water control and water conveyance structures intended to preserve an
approximately 600 acre inundated aquatic environment, a characteristic feature of the
Atchafalaya ecosystem. Land use should not change as a result of the continued implementation
of the owner’s water management plan. Additional recreational activities may be pursued by the
permittee, including hunting, trapping, fishing, crawfishing, and birdwatching. No changes to
the-existing water control and conveyance structures or water management plan has been
requested.
(X) Economics. The local economy could receive negligible benefits from the sales and
tax revenues associated with the purchase of hunting, fishing, and other state licenses,
recreational equipment and supplies, fuel and associated recreational expenses paid by the
property’s owner and invitees.
` (X) Prime and unique farmland (7 CFR Part 658). No portion of the project site
includes any farmlands. Soils listed under Section ll C. are not identified as prime and unique
farmlands because of potential flooding restrictions, as described in the St. Martin Parish Soil
Survey published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service. Any
attempted farming efforts would probably cause significant disturbances to existing bottomland
hardwood habitat and would be subj ect to a high risk of devastating flooding and crop failure.
_ (X) Food and fiber production. No commercial production of food or fiber products is
anticipated from the continued use of Fisher Bottom as a hunting and recreational property by its
new owners under the terms of the existing permit. Oversight of the habitat in conformity with
the water management plan should preserve the property’s 600 acre forested swamp in a
generally inundated condition, attracting waterfowl and other aquatic species. Recreational
hunting by the property’s owners and their invitees may lead to the negligible acquisition of
specialty food items, such as duck. Fishing and crawfish harvesting in Fisher Bottom is expected
to remain a recreational activity of the property’s owners. Because access to Fisher Bottom by
watercraft is limited to periods of elevated floodwaters, as described above, and because legal
entry by commercial crawfishermen may require permission from the property’s owners, we
cannot forecast the future level of commercial production of crawfish at Fisher Bottom, if any.
(X) General water quality. Submerged and emergent aquatic vegetation within the
project area help to improve water quality through the natural filtration that these plant species
provide. During the March 30, 2012 site visit the District’s biologists found the water quality to
be clear enough to allow penetration of sunlight to submerged plants and to the substrate.
(X) Mineral needs. N/A
(X) Consideration of private property. Department of the Army permits grant no
property rights nor authorize damage to property. Documentation provided to the District by the
party seeking this permit transfer, Atchafalaya Investments, LLC, indicate that it is the property’s
new owner, having purchased Fisher Bottom from the original permittee, Mallard Basin, LLC.
i (X) other. N/A

F. Summary of secondary and cumulative effects:
(1) Secondary effects:
The DA permit under re-evaluation here was issued to Mallard Basin, LLC on October 6,
2010 on an after-the-fact basis. After receiving notice of unpermitted work undertaken in
jurisdictional wetlands on the subject property the District followed the requirements of 33CFR
331.10 and initiated a process to bring the unpermitted work into compliance with the terms of
Sec. 404 of the Clean Water Act. The unpermitted activity consisted of the replacement of one
or more existing wooden weirs with a modern structure, improvements to an embankment
around the new water containment structure, the clearing of 1,878 linear feet of a water
conveyance ditch through both wetlands and uplands, including excavation of sections of new
ditch, and the installation of a permanent electric water pump on the western bank of the
Whiskey Bay Pilot Channel. About 1,491 feet of the water conveyance ditch cross non-
jurisdictional uplands which are not subject to regulation by this agency.
Today the habitat surrounding sections of the water conveyance ditch traversing
jurisdictional wetlands shows minimal elevation changes, indicating that spoil banks have eroded
and flattened, with indicators of hydric soils, including a healthy cover of wetlands plant species,
now the norm.
On the basis of our recent field investigation at the project site we find no present adverse
secondary effects persisting as ia consequence of the placement of fill material on jurisdictional
wetlands approximately a decade ago during construction/ reconstruction of the water control
and water conveyance structures for which the after-the-fact DA permit was issued. Although
some wetlands acreage may have experienced temporary setbacks at the time of construction, no
residual adverse effects can now be detected.
On the other hand, we find evidence of persistent secondary benefits to the Fisher Bottom
wetland habitat arising from the reconstruction work undertaken by the property’s prior owner to
improve the property’s water management system. Approximately 700 acres of inundated
wetland habitat characteristic of the Atchafalaya Basin is more likely to be preserved in a healthy
condition under the water management plan developed by Mallard Basin LLC, which the new
property owner has committed to follow, than if the property’s water control and conveyance
infrastructure were removed and the water management plan abandoned.
(2) Cumulative effects:
ln preparing this EA we established the scope of our cumulative impacts analysis to
include the greater Atchafalaya Basin habitat. While this project- specifically its variable
crested water control structure, approximately 1,900 linear feet of water conveyance ditch, water
pump, and continued operation of these facilities in accordance with the existing “moist soil”
water management plan - affects only a small part of the over-all Atchafalaya habitat, we believe
the project may provide long-term benefits for the wider floodway by preserving the health of
Fisher Bottom’s 700 acres of inundated bottomland hardwood enviromiient. These benefits
contrast with a broader picture of negative cumulative impacts of htunan activity that have
collectively degraded other parts of the wider floodway, as discussed below.
~ Over the last century the natural bottomland hardwood ecosystem of the Atchafalaya

21
Basin, the largest contiguous freshwater swamp habitat in North America, has experienced
numerous changes as a consequence of public and private navigation activities, construction of
flood control levees and structures, oil and gas exploration and production, and agricultural and
commercial development. Large civil works water resource projects inspired in part by the
Flood of 1927, including dredging and straightening of the Atchafalaya River and construction of
the Whiskey Bay Pilot Channel, have cumulatively contributed to major changes in the
Atchafalaya’s hydrology and water circulation patterns, promoting accelerated sedimentation in
some parts of the basin and a reduction in floodwater flows in other parts, among other effects.
- The District finds that the water and moist soil management regime underway at Fisher
Bottom is likely to maintain the property’s forested wetland habitat, while removal of the water
control structure, water conveyance ditch and intake pump at the Whiskey Bay Pilot Channel, as
required if we were to adopt the “no action” alternative, would more likely lead to a shrinking of
the present 700 acres of inundated swamp and the increasing presence of various invasive
species. The Corps’ regulatory enforcement program is tasked with defending a national federal
policy of “no net loss of wetlands.” While the cumulative effect of past human activities and
projects on wetlands in the Atchafalaya Basin is a present reduction in the footprint of high
quality forested wetlands within the floodway, we find that this project will offset some of those
losses through the proj ect’s likely preservation of the Fisher Bottom inundated wetland habitat in
a healthy condition. Finally, the Corps is unaware of any additional proposed or reasonably
foreseeable future actions that are expected to have any additional impacts in the Fisher Bottom
area.
G. Mitigation:
i The District reconfirms its original finding that no permanent loss of wetland habitat
appears to have occurred as a consequence of the construction activities undertaken a decade ago
by Mallard Basin, and permitted through the after-the-fact permitting process. We found no
evidence of adverse project impacts at Fisher Bottom during any of the agency’s site
investigations, although short-term temporal losses may have occurred at the time of project
construction.
The healthy native bottomland hardwood habitat that presently characterizes the Fisher
Bottom property appears to owe some of its wetlands values to the on-going moist soil
management program begun by Mallard Basin, LLC. Because we can measure no project-
related wetland losses, mitigation is not an appropriate permit condition.

interested parties (mailing list) including appropriate state and federal agencies. This
revised Decision Document and permit reevaluation was prepared in response to a
written request by the property’s recent buyer, Atchafalaya Investments, LLC, for a
transfer of the existing permit into the buyer’s name, and a lawsuit brought against the
agency by the Louisiana Crawfish Producers Association - West and the Tulane
Environmental Law Clinic, alleging that the original Decision Document failed to
adequately analyze project-related impacts to endangered species. The comments below
are set forth in two sections for chronological clarity - Section 1 contains a summary of
the original comments received after publication of the original public notice, along with
updated agency responses, and Section 2 contains comments received after publication

1. S UMIMARY OF COMMENTS RECEIVED IN RESPONSE T O PUBLI CA T I ON OF
THE ORIGINAL PERIWI T APPLI CA T I ON AND A GEN C Y ’S RESPONSES:
a. Federal agencies:
` i) U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The permit application was forwarded to
the New Orleans District (NOD), Real Estate Division to determine whether the proposed project
would impact real estate interests under the jurisdiction of the NOD. By memo dated May 28,
2010, the Real Estate Division indicated that no real estate instrument was required for issuance
of the original permit.
ii) U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service). No response to Public Notice was
received. On February 2, 2011, the Corps again advised the Service, by letter, of the Mallard
Basin after-the-fact permit, and noting that no comments related to possible effects to
endangered or threatened species had been received from the Service. Our letter included the
following observation:
The Corps is concerned with ensuring proper consultation with FWS concerning
threatened and endangered species namely the Louisiana Black Bear. By this letter, we
are providing FWS with the opportunity to express any comments or concerns regarding
the permitted activity and any possible negative effects on Louisiana Black Bear habitat.
The Corps will then consider all comments and the possibility of a modification to the
existing permit authorizations.
(See Attachment No. VII-a: letter from USACE New Orleans District to USFWS, dated
February 2, 2011).
On February 28, 2011 the Service responded by letter and included the following

23
explanatory comments:
The Service does not enter into Section 7 consultations on permit applications when
applicants are seeking “after the fact” authorization for projects or portions of projects that
have already completed. Such completed projects effectively limit any options for
formulation or implementation of reasonable and prudent alternatives that avoid
jeopardizing the continued existence of federally listed species or destroying or modifying
their designated critical habitats. The consultation process is intended to address the
impacts of “proposed” actions rather than past, ongoing, or future effects of completed
projects. Therefore, the Service, by policy, does not consult after-the-fact on completed
actions.
_ (See Attachment V11: letter dated February 28, 2012 from USFWS to New Orleans
District.)
iii) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA submitted no
comments during the original public notice period.
b. State and local agencies:
- i) Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF). The Louisiana
Department of Wildlife & Fisheries, by letter dated June 7, 2010, stated that the applicant shall
provide adequate and appropriate mitigation for impacts to wetland functions. Any forested
vegetation cleared should be chipped and spread in a beneficial manner, or hauled offsite to a
non-wetland disposal location.
The Corps found no adverse impacts to wetland ftmctions at the time the original permit
application was reviewed. Additionally, because construction of the water control structure and
restoration/ excavation of the water conveyance ditch occurred approximately ten years before
the District received Mallard Basin’s after-the-fact permit application, vegetative debris from
project construction activity had already decomposed to an insignificant state, obviating the
LDWF’s best practice guidance recommending the chipping and spreading of this material. A
water management plan prepared by the LDWF for the project became a condition of the issued
permit.
c. Organizations.
` A comment letter dated April 15, 2010 was submitted by Leigh Haynie, attorney-at-law,
15 Chapel Hill Street, Pike Road, AL 36064, on behalf of Atchafalaya Basinkeeper and the
Louisiana Crawfish Producers Association (LCPA)-West, offering numerous comments and
opposing issuance of this permit. Ms. Haynie presented allegations of environmental harm, or
procedural inadequacy by the agency during permit processing, related to ntunerous topics,
including the following: traffic safety, the public notice process, omission of geographic
features from project plats, inadequacy of the proposed water management plan, sheet flow of
rain and floodwaters, dredging in an existing bayou, need for an Environmental Impact
Statement for the project, potential production of proj ect-related greenhouse gases, the danger of
sediment accumulations with the Basin, wetlands losses within the project site, prospective harm
to special aquatic sites and shellfish production areas, oxygen deprivation to waters within the
Atchafalaya Basin, the inadequacy of duck hunting as a project purpose, disruption of water
circulation at Fisher Bottom by project structures, an absence of proj ect-related mitigation,

24
inadequacy of project drawings, a need for public hearings, protection of the culture and
livelihood of local inhabitants and Cajun heritage, project effects 'on endangered species
including the Louisiana black bear, Florida panther, peregrine falcon and the lvory-billed
Woodpecker, the danger of oxygen depletion in water bodies within the Basin, harms caused by
invasive species, and various additional comments.
d. Individuals. No comments from individuals were received.
e. Agency response to comments received after publication of permit application.
Comments received during the original public notice period were compiled and
forwarded to the applicant, Mallard Basin, LLC. ln a letter dated July l5, 20l0 Mallard Basin
offered its responses.
After agency review of the questions and objections presented by Ms. Haynie and review
of the permit applicant’s responses to her allegations, as well as our review of the management
plan for Mallard Basin furnished by the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, our
review of the District’s jurisdictional determination for the project site, and our observations of
project habitat during various site visits, we determined that the proj ect’s likely preservation of
approximately six hundred acres of flooded, Cypress/ Tupelo swamp and bottomland hardwood
habitat was more favorable to the surrounding ecosystem than the alternative action
recommended by Ms. Haynie, removal of the existing embankment and water control structures,
which would cause Fisher Bottom’s flooded swamp to drain significantly during extended
portions of the year. Wetlands that may have been disturbed during project construction a decade
ago now display healthy wetlands values. On the basis of these observations and conclusions,
we determined that the project was not contrary to the public interest.
f. Individuals. No comments were received.

b. State agencies.
On March 30, 2012, waterfowl biologists with the LDWF attended a site visit to Fisher
Bottom to observe the project infrastructure and assess the quality of habitat subject to the
owner’s on-going water management plan. In an e-mail dated April 2, 2012, Paul Link,
waterfowl biologist with LDWF, provided written observations and advised that removal of the
project, or suspension of the water management plan, could adversely affect the project’s
wetlands:
ln my opinion, the wildlife habitat was greatly improved via this proj ect’s activities.
Without the annual management and manipulation of the water control structures the area
that currently produces a multitude of beneficial seed-producing plants for waterfowl

25
would quickly be overtaken by less desirable species. ..
(See Attachment III: email from Paul Link LDWF, dated April 2, 2012.)
In a letter dated April 20, 2012, LDWF made no objection to the current management
plan (see Attachment XIII: letter from Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries dated
April 20, 2012).
An LDWF biologist who specializes in studying the Louisiana black bear and its habitat,
and who leads the LDWF Large Carnivore Section, Maria Davidson, also participated in the
March 30, 2012 visit to Fisher Bottom to observe project structures, features and habitat.
Following the field trip Ms. Davidson sent a letter to the Corps, received on May 7, 2012, in
which she concluded that the Fisher Basin project showed no adverse impact on the Louisiana
Black bear (see Attachment X: letter from LDWF Large Carnivore Section received May 7,
2012).

c. Organizations.
Paul Davidson, Executive Director ofthe Black Bear Conservation Coalition, connnented
by letter dated April 10, 2012 in follow-up to his visit to the Fisher Bottom site on March 30,
2012. Mr. Davidson stated that after looking at the water control structure, pump, water
distribution system and the Fisher Bottom impoundment area, he saw nothing that could be
adverse to the well being of the black bear. Mr. Davidson observed that the Fisher Bottom
[Mallard Basin] site possesses excellent bottomland hardwood habitat for bears and other wild
fauna. l\/lr. Davidson saw no evidence of black bears on the property, but said he would expect
bears to use the area as a transit corridor as their population increases (see Attachment IX: letter
from Paul Davidson, Executive Director BBCC, dated April 20, 2012).

3. EVALUATION:
I have reviewed and evaluated, in light of the overall public interest, the documents
and factors concerning the proposed transfer of this permit, as well as the stated views of
other interested agencies and the concerned public. In doing so, I have considered the
possible consequences of this action in accordance with regulations published in 33 CFR
Part 320 to 330 and 40 CFR Part 230. The following paragraphs set forth my evaluation
of comments received and the project’s degree of compliance with the above-cited
regulations.

26
a. Consideration of original comments received in response to public notice of
permit application:
The Atchafalaya Basinikeeper provided numerous comments and recommendations on a
variety of environmental, economic, navigation and natural resource topics. The Corps reviewed
these comments, forwarded them to the permittee, and reviewed the permit applicant’s detailed
responses. For reference to comments provided by Atchafalaya Basinkeeper, see April 15, 2010
letter from Leigh Haynie. For reference to responses provided by Mallard Basin Inc., see letter
from Tim Morton and Associates dated July 15, 2010, Attachment No. Xl.
With regard to the Basinkeepers’ allegation, submitted by Ms. Haynie, that the project
restricts access by commercial fishing interests to Fisher Bottom, the Corps concluded, after
multiple field investigations of the project site, that the shallow watercourse below Fisher
Bottom’s water control structure disburses into a forested floodplain whose mature trees are too
tightly distributed to allow access by watercraft, except during extreme flood stages when the
Atchafalaya River reaches 17 feet or higher at the Butte LaRose gauge. During these high water
events, most of the project site is accessible by boat through the flooded, forested areas and the
project structures would not obstruct passage.
With regard to the Basinkeepers’ demand that compensatory mitigation be required to
fully offset any project related impacts, the Corps reaffirms after recent site visits the validity of
our Surveillance and Enforcement Division’s Jurisdictional Determination, which found no
adverse, proj ect-related impacts to wetlands. All affected areas within the project site remain
functioning wetlands with obvious benefits from the permittee’s water management regime. Due
to these findings, we conclude that no mitigation is required as a condition of the subject permit.
Other comments provided by the Basinkeeper were satisfactorily answered/ responded to
in a letter provided by Tim Morton and Associates on behalf of Mallard Basin Inc. except
comments related to threatened or endangered species, which the District independently
investigated.
- Sampling and testing of excavated material deposited as spoil during Mallard Basin’s
channel improvement work a decade ago is not indicated because the site is not believed to
contain any significant soil contaminants or pollutants, making further analysis to ensure
compliance with the Environmental Protection Agency’s guidelines for disposal of fill material
unnecessary (see also discussion above).
Because no significant enviromnental impacts to the project site arising from operation of
the water control and conveyance system in accordance with the project owner’s water
management plan could be found, preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement is not
required. We find that the project clearly helps to preserve approximately 700 acres of existing
forested wetland which has benefited from an active water management program for more than
fifty years. Significant enviromnental impacts could occur if the water management
infrastructure is removed and the management program is suspended.
. b. Evaluation of Compliance with 404 (b)(1) guidelines (restrictions on discharge,
40 CFR 230.10).
- The regulatory language of 33 CFR 320.4(a) states that “[f] or activities involving 404
discharges, a permit will not be granted if the discharge that would be authorized by such permit

27
would not comply With the Environmental Protection Agency‘s 404(b)(l) guidelines.” Similarly,
33 CFR 323.6(a) states that “The district engineer Will review applications for permits for the
discharge of dredged or fill materials into the Waters of the United States in accordance with
guidelines promulgated by the Administrator, EPA, under authority of section 404(b)(l) of the
CWA.” (See 40 CFR pan 230.)

potential adverse impacts of the discharge on the
aquatic ecosystem?
c. General Evaluation (33 CFR 320.4(a)):
i) The relative extent of the public and private need for the proposed work...
The project would provide private landowners recreational opportunities through the
management of approximately 600 acres of forested swamp and bottomland hardwoods. The
project would help to preserve a semi-open canopy swamp and moist soil vegetative area which
will provide direct and ctunulative benefits to the regional aquatic environment through
biodiversity of vegetative communities and wildlife species. Since the turn of the Twentieth
Century, the Atchafalaya Basin has lost numerous acres of shallow water features due to
accretion of tloodwater sediments. The protection of approximately 700 acres of shallow water
cypress and tupelo swamplands will help to offset losses of similar habitat in other portions of

29
the Atchafalaya Basin.
- ii) The practicabillity of using reasonable alternative locations and methods to
accomplish the objective of the proposed structure or Work... The permittee has provided
sufficient information to identify the public and private value of the project and has reasonably
demonstrated that no less environmentally damaging alternatives exist that could practicably
provide similar preservation benefits, as previously addressed in Section II-B of this document.
iii) The extent and permanence of the beneficial and/or detrimental effects that
the proposed structures or work may have on the public and private uses to which the area
is suited... The project area currently provides habitat for Wildlife and aquatic organisms that
depend on forested Wetlands. It also functions to absorb nutrients, trap sediments, store storm
Water, and provide detrital material for adjacent Wetlands and Water bodies. While the project
owners’ interests primarily focus on recreational activities, these align with the long-term public
benefit that continued Water management of the property should provide, in particular the
preservation of approximately '700 acres of forested Wetlands and the protection of numerous fish
and Wildlife connntmities.
_ d. Significant national issues of overriding importance to state or local issues and
why.
None.
4. DETERJWINA TION:
a. Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) (33 CFR Part 325.) Having reviewed
the information provided by the original permit applicant, by the proposed transfer permittee,
and by interested organizations and individuals, as well as the assessment of environmental
impacts contained in Part Il B of this document, I find that transfer of these permits Without
modification will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment.
Therefore, an Environmental Impact Statement will not be required.
b. 404(b)(1) Compliance/Non-compliance Review (40 CFR 230.12).
( ) The discharge complies With the guidelines.
( X) The discharge complies with the guidelines, with the inclusion of the appropriate
and practicable conditions listed above (in lll.B.2.b.iv) to minimize pollution or
adverse effects to the affected ecosystem.
( ) The discharge fails to comply with the requirements of these guidelines because:
( ) There is a practicable alternative to the proposed discharge that would have
less adverse effect on the aquatic ecosystem and that alternative does not
have other significant adverse enviromnental consequences.
( ) The proposed discharge will result in significant degradation of the aquatic
ecosystem under 40 CFR 230.l0(b) or (c).
( ) The discharge does not include all appropriate and practicable measures to

.1=_ 
_ail-
,l 
30
minimize potential harm to the aquatic ecosystem, namely the relocation ofthe -
project to the non-wet portions of the property.
( ) There is not sufiicient information to make a reasonable judgment as to
whether the proposed discharge will comply with the guidelines.
c. Public Interest Determination: I find that transfer of DA Permit No. MVN-201 O-
l080-WLL (with special conditions) to the new owner of Fisher Bottom, Atchafalaya
Investments, LLC, as well as recognition of Atchafalaya Investments, LLC as a
qualified permittee under Nationwide Permit No. 7 (with respect to its continued use
ofthe \lVhisl<ey Bay Pilot Channel intake and outfall pipe and water pump, as
presently operated), as prescribed by regulations published in 33 CFR Parts 320 to
330, and 40 CFR Part 230:
