PERMIT MODIFICATION TO CONSTRUCT MULTIPLE FAMILY DWELLINGS
IN ST. TAMMY PARISH
NAME OF APPLICANT: Resource Bank, c/o: Villere Town Planning Assoc., 110 East Seventh
Street, Covington, Louisiana 70433.
LOCATION OF WORK: In St. Tammany Parish, on the Tchefuncte River, off of Anne Street, in
Covington, Louisiana.
*NOTE: This is a proposed non-compliance resolution, permit modification, and transfer of
DA permit EF-19-990-2780, issued March 27, 2002.
CHARACTER OF WORK: Permit modification to construct an access road with culverts, install a
boat house and bulkheads, construct a driveway, and fill for an access road; in order to develop
multiple family dwellings on the Tchefuncte River in St. Tammany Parish. The original DA permit
included the depicted single family residence located at Parcel C-1-B, an access driveway from Anne
Street, and a bridge crossing at Parcel A. All original wetlands impacts were mitigated under the
March 27, 2002 permit.
Existing conditions at the site include: (1) a change in use from a single family residence to a multifamily development, (2) a permanent fill road at Parcel A, (3) and unauthorized fill placement
associated with the previously authorized access road. Modified plans will include impacting 0.75 of
an acre of additional jurisdiction forested wetlands. As shown in the attached drawings, the applicant
has proposed to restore approximately 0.48 of an acre of unauthorized wetland impacts and avoid 0.89
acres of previous permitted (high quality tupelo/swamp habitat) at the site; in order to off-set the 0.75
acres of additional wetland impacts. Supplemental information and or project clarification may be
acquired from the project manager with this office, upon request.

The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality WQC will close 20 days from the date of this joint public notice. Written
comments, including suggestions for modifications or objections to the proposed work, stating reasons
thereof, are being solicited from anyone having interest in this permit and/or this WQC request and
must be mailed so as to be received before or by the last day of the comment period. Letters
concerning the Corps of Engineers permit application must reference the applicant's name and the
Permit Application Number, and be mailed to the Corps of Engineers at the address above,
ATTENTION: REGULATORY BRANCH. Individuals or parties may request an extension of time in
which to comment on the proposed work by writing to the project manager or clicking on the project
managerâ€™s name on the public notice grid on the web page. Any request must be specific and
substantively supportive of the requested extension, and received by this office prior to the end of the
initial comment period. The Section Chief will review the request and the requestor will be promptly

to the initial comment period and, inclusive of the initial comment period, will not exceed a total of 30
calendar days. Letters concerning the Water Quality Certification must reference the applicant's name

Quality at the address above.

Copies may be obtained upon payment of costs of reproduction.
Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts,
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect
the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which
reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably
foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including
the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general
environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards,
floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and
conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs,
considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and
local agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate
the impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this
proposal. To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic
properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above.
Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental
Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to
determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed
activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The
possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological,
scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State
Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as
critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species.

This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the
Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result
in the destruction or alteration of approximately n/a acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red
drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a
substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final
determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by
and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the
evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity
will not violate applicable water quality standards will be required from the Department of
Environmental Quality, before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a
public hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with
particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties
whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.
