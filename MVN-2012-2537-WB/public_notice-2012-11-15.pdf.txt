evaluation of the probable impact including cumulative impacts of
the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will
reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization
of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may be
expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its
reasonably foreseeable detriments. all factors which may be
relevant to the proposal will be considered including the
cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation,
economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands,
historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards,
floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and
accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water
quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral
needs, consideration of property ownership and, in general, the
needs and welfare of the people.
The Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the
public; federal, state, and local agencies and officials; Indian
Tribes; and other interested parties in order to consider and
evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments
received will be considered by the Corps of Engineers to
determine whether to issue, modify, condition or deny a permit
for this proposal. To make this decision, comments are used to
assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water
quality, general environmental effects, and the other public
interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the
preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or Environmental
Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy
Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public

Places are near the proposed work. The possibility exists that
the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown
archeological, scientific, prehistorical or historical sites or

fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination
relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures
is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine
Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill
material into navigable waters, the evaluation of the probable
impacts will include the application of guidelines established by
the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and
certification that the proposed activity will not violate
