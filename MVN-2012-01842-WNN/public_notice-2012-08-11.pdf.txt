concerning the Water Quality Certification must reference the applicant’s name and the WQC Application number and be
mailed to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality at the address above.
The application for this proposed project is on file with the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and

Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including
cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That ,decision will reflect the national concern for both
protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the
proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the
proposal will be considered, including the cumulative effects thereof; among these being: conservation, economics,
aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards,
floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water
quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in
general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agencies and
officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity.
Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify,
condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered
species, historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above.
Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement
pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing
and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The possibility exists
that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistoric, or historical sites
or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as endangered by the U.S.
Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and recovery of any
endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery
Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or alteration of Q acres of
EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action
would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final
determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination
with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of the
probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable water quality standards will
be required from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality before a permit is issued.
_ Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public hearing be
held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the reasons for holding a
public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties whom you deem
likely to have interest in the matter.
