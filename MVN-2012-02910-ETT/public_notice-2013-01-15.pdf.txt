Act (86 Stat. 816; 33 USC 1344).
Application has also been made to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, for a
Water Quality Certification (WQC) in accordance with statutory authority contained in LRS30:2047 A(3),

INSTALL FIVE TYPES OF SHORELINE PROTECTION AT THREE LOCTIONS IN
JEFFERSON, LAFOURCHE & IBERRIA PARISHES, LOUISIANA
NAME OF APPLICANT: Louisiana Coastal Protection & Restoration Authority c/o USDA-NRCS.
Attention; Loland Broussard, 646 Cajundome Boulevard, Lafayette, Louisiana 70506.
LOCATIONS OF WORK: 1.) Lake Salvador at Latitude: 29.71171 Longitude: -90.1966, Jefferson
Parish; 2.) Bayou Perot at Latitude: 29.62321, Longitude: -90.18068, Lafourche Parish; 3.) Shark Island
at Latitude: 29.77721, Longitude: -90.85663, Iberia Parish; Louisiana.
CHARACTER OF WORK: At Lake Salvador dredge +121,000 cubic yards of sediments from +25
acres of non vegetated tidal bottoms to create an access channel to place five non-rock shoreline
protection structures totaling +11,600 cubic yards into +3 acres of non vegetated tidal shorelines. The
dredge spoil materials would be temporarily side cast into +22 acres of non vegetated tidal bottoms along
the access channel. At Bayou Perot dredge +162,000 cubic yards of sediments from +28 acres of non
vegetated tidal bottoms to create an access channel to place five non-rock shoreline protection structures
totaling +11,600 cubic yards into +3 acres of non vegetated tidal shorelines. The dredge spoil materials
would be temporarily side cast into +24 acres of non vegetated tidal bottoms along the access channel. At
Shark Island dredge +49,000 cubic yards of materials from +14 acres of non vegetated tidal bottoms to
create an access channel to place five non-rock shoreline protection structures totaling +11,600 cubic
yards of materials into +3 acres of non vegetated tidal shorelines. The dredge spoil materials would be
temporarily side cast into +14 acres of non vegetated tidal bottoms along the access channel.

2
Five different types of non-rock shoreline protection structures will be installed at each location,
as part of the “Non-Rock Alternatives to Shoreline Protection” CWPPRA demonstration projects. The
five structures vary in design and are constructed from various combinations of: concrete-formed
materials, steel support pilings, high density polyethylene materials, fiberglass support pilings and PVC
pipe materials. No permanent wetland impacts are proposed and no mitigation is proposed.
The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality WQC will close 20 days from the date of this joint public notice. Written
comments, including suggestions for modifications or objections to the proposed work, stating reasons
thereof, are being solicited from anyone having interest in this permit and/or this WQC request and must
be mailed so as to be received before or by the last day of the comment period. Letters concerning the
Corps of Engineers permit application must reference the applicant's name and the Permit Application
Number, and be mailed to the Corps of Engineers at the address above, ATTENTION: REGULATORY
BRANCH. Individuals or parties may request an extension of time in which to comment on the proposed
work by writing to the project manager or clicking on the project manager’s name on the public notice
grid on the web page. Any request must be specific and substantively supportive of the requested
extension, and received by this office prior to the end of the initial comment period. The Section Chief
will review the request and the requestor will be promptly notified of the decision to grant or deny the
request. If granted, the time extension will be continuous to the initial comment period and, inclusive of
the initial comment period, will not exceed a total of 30 calendar days. Letters concerning the Water
Quality Certification must reference the applicant's name and the WQC Application number and be
mailed to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality at the address above. The application for
this proposed project is on file with the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and may be
examined during weekdays between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Copies may be obtained upon payment of
costs of reproduction
The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies with
and will be conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program. The
Department of the Army permit will not be issued unless the applicant receives approval or a waiver of
the Coastal Use Permit by the Department of Natural Resources.
Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts,
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the
national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably
may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable
detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative
effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns,
wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use,
navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality,
energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and,
in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the

3
impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make
this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water
quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used
in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant
to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public
hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
The Corps of Engineers is unaware of any properties listed on the National Register of Historic
Places at or near the proposed work site. The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or
destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this
notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
The Corps is unaware of any Endangered Species Act (ESA) listed species that may occur in the
project area. Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any ESA listed species nor
affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and recovery of any ESA listed species.
This notice initiates the EFH consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery
Conservation and Management Act. The proposal would result in temporary impacts to +127 acres of
EFH and permanent impacts to +9 acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum, blue crab and
penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action may have an adverse impact on EFH
or federally managed fisheries of the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impacts
and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the NMFS.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the
evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity
will not violate applicable water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental
Quality, Office of Environmental Services, before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a
public hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with
particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties
whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.
