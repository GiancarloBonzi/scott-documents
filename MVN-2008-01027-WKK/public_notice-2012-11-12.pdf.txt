COrpS of Engineers Permit Criteria

The decision whether to grant a time extension will be based on an evaluation of the
probable impacts, including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public
interest. That decision will reflect the national concern for both protection and
utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may be expected to
accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments.
All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the
cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general
environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood
hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion,
recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and
fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general,
the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal,
state, and local agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in
order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments
received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether to
grant or deny a time extension for the General Permit. To make this decision, comments
are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality,
general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments
are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact
Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to
determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the overall public interest of
the proposed activity.
The possibility exists that work conducted under this General Permit may damage or
destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or
data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State
Historic Preservation Officer for review and comment.
Authorization would not be granted under the General Permit for proposed work that
would affect any species listed as endangered by the U.s. Departments of Interior or
Commerce, or affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and recovery of
any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of
the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Our initial determination
is that actions authorized under the General Permit would not have a substantial adverse
impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final
determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject
to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If work proposed, under this General Permit involves deposits of dredged or fill
material into navigable waters, the evaluation of the probable impacts will include the
application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the Environmental
Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate
applicable water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental
Quality, Office of water Resources before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this
notice, that a public hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public
hearings shall state, with particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing.
