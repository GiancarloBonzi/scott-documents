STEAMBOAT OVERLOOK IN MISSISSIPPI RIVER
NAME OF APPLICANT: Port Cargo Services, c/o Murray Architects, 131 Ormond Center Court,

drawings.
CHARACTER OF WORK: Clear an area to allow for the construction of walkways and a pilesupported structure that will house a museum with steamboat and river navigation exhibits.
Approximately 1700 cubic yards of material will be excavated for pile cap installation. Approximately
2150 cubic yards of concrete/rip rap will be placed on-site. The proposed activity would impact
approximately 1 acre of forested wetland and 1 acre of herbaceous wetland. To compensate for
unavoidable wetland impacts, the applicant proposes to purchase credits from a Corps approved
mitigation bank located within the watershed. Work will be performed as shown in the enclosed
drawings.

- 2 Environmental Quality WQC will close 30 days from the date of this joint public notice. Written

Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts,
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect
the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit, which
reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal, must be balanced against its reasonably
foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including
the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general
environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain
values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation,
water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property
ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the
impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To
make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties,
water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments
are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement
pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a
public hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
Three sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The
possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological,
scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State
Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Pallid sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus) is known to occur in the Mississippi River and and is
believed to spawn in Louisiana. Our initial finding is that the proposed work would not adversely affect
the pallid sturgeon, would not affect any other species listed as endangered by the U.S. Departments of
Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and recovery of any
endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the
destruction or alteration of N/Aacre(s) of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid
shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse

- 3 impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to
project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the
National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the
evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity
will not violate water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality,
Office of Environmental Services
before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public
hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity,
the reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties
whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.
The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies with and
will be conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program. The
Department of the Army permit will not be issued unless the applicant received approval or a waiver of
the Coastal Use Permit by the Department of Natural Resources.
