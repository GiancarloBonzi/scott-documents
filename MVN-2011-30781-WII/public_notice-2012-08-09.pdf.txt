Interested parties are hereby notified that a permit application has been received
by the New Orleans District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to:
[X] Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of March 3, 1899 (30 Stat. 1151; 33 USC 403);
and/or [X] Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (86 Stat. 816; 33 USC 1344).
Application has also been made to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality,
Office of Environmental Services, for a Water Quality Certification (WQC) in accordance
with statutory authority contained in LRS 30:2074 A(3) and provisions of Section 401 of
the Clean Water Act (P.L.95-17).
NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS PIPELINE IN CALCASIEU, JEFFERSON DAVIS, ALLEN AND ACADIA PARISH
NAME OF APPLICANT: CROSSTEX NGL PIPELINE, L.P., c/o John Chance Land Surveys, Inc., Attn:
Mr. Aaron C. Landry, 200 Dulles Drive, Lafayette, Louisiana 70506.
LOCATION OF WORK: Within a 137 mile long pipeline corridor beginning at a tie-in point
with an existing system near Mont Belvieu, Texas, then proceeding east-northeast for
approximately 70 miles within the New Orleans District and terminating at the existing
Crosstex natural gas liquids fractionation plant near Eunice, Louisiana. All as shown in
the attached drawings. Project components will occur in Calcasieu, Jefferson Davis, Allen
and Acadia Parishes.
CHARACTER OF WORK: Clear rights-of-way, conduct trenching operations, temporarily
stockpile approximately 453,316 cubic yards of material, dredge flotation canals and
perform horizontal directional drilling operations, all as necessary to install
approximately 70 miles of 12-inch natural gas liquids pipeline, with associated structures
to include emergency block-off valves, pump stations, metering stations and pig launcher
and receiver facilities. All work as previously described is to construct, operate and
maintain facilities and equipment as required to provide a pipeline system to receive and
transport natural gas liquids resources which is critical in meeting the nation and local
market near future energy demands. Project implementation would impact approximately 39.3
acres of jurisdictional wetlands. The applicant proposes to compensate for project
related unavoidable wetland impacts by purchasing mitigation credits or possibly
implementing a Corps approved permittee responsible mitigation project within the New
Orleans District. This project was previously placed on public notice in January 2012,
since that time some areas have been surveyed that previously did not have access
permission and corrections were made to the previous jurisdictional determination. Also,
a new temporary access road has been added to the east side of the Calcasieu River.

The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana
Department of Environmental Quality WQC will close 20 days from the date of this joint
public notice. Written comments, including suggestions for modifications or objections to
the proposed work, stating reasons thereof, are being solicited from anyone having
interest in this permit and/or this WQC request and must be mailed so as to be received
before or by the last day of the comment period. Letters concerning the Corps of
Engineers permit application must reference the applicant's name and the Permit
Application Number, and be mailed to the Corps of Engineers at the address above,
ATTENTION: REGULATORY BRANCH. Similar letters concerning the Water Quality Certification
must reference the applicant's name and the WQC Application number and be mailed to the
Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality at the address above. Individuals or parties

may request an extension of time in which to comment on the proposed work by writing to the project
manager or clicking on the project manager’s name on the public notice grid on the web page. Any
request must be specific and substantively supportive of the requested extension, and received by this
office prior to the end of the initial comment period. The Section Chief will review the request and the
requestor will be promptly notified of the decision to grant or deny the request. If granted, the time
extension will be continuous to the initial comment period and, inclusive of the initial comment period,
will not exceed a total of 30 calendar days.
The application for this proposed project is on file with the Louisiana Department
of Environmental Quality and may be examined during weekdays between 8:00 a.m. and
4:30 p.m. Copies may be obtained upon payment of costs of reproduction.
Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the
probable impacts, including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public
interest. That decision will reflect the national concern for both protection and
utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may be expected to
accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments.
All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the
cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general
environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood
hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion,
recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and
fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the
needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal,
state, and local agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in
order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments
received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether to
make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision,
comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water
quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above.
Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an
Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.
Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the
overall public interest of the proposed activity.

No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the
proposed work. The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy
presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data.
Copies of this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic
Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species
listed as endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any
habitat designated as critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of
the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal
would result in the destruction or alteration of N/A acres of EFH utilized by various life
stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed
action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries
in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need
for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine
Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable
waters, the evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines
established by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a
certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable water quality
standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, Office of
Environmental Services before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this
notice, that a public hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public
hearings shall state, with particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any
other parties whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.
