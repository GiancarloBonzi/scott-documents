Interested parties are hereby notified that a permit application has been received by the New
Orleans District ofthe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to: [X] Section 10 of the Rivers and
Harbors Act of March 3, 1899 (30 Stat. 1151; 33 USC 403); and/or [X] Section 404 ofthe Clean
Water Act (86 Stat. 816; 33 USC 1344).
Application has also been made to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, Office of
Environmental Services, for a Water Quality Certification (WQC) in accordance with statutory
authority contained in LRS 30:2074 A(3) and provisions of Section 401 of the Clean Water Act.
PROPOSED MODIFICATION TO CHOUPIC LEVEE C IN LAFOURCHE PARISH
NAME OF APPLICANT: Lafourche Parish Government, c/o Picciola & Associates, Inc., ATTN:
Brad Adams, Post Office Box 687, Cut Off, Louisiana 70345.
LOCATION OF WORK: In Chackbay (Chegby), Louisiana, in Section 106, T14S-R16E, in
Lafourche Parish, as shown on the attached drawings.
CHARACTER OF WORK: The applicant has requested modification to a Department of the
Army (DoA) permit issued on July 2, 2005, which authorized the clearing, grading, excavation and
deposition of fill material to construct and maintain the Choupic Levee C for flood protection to
include a borrow canal, screw-gate culverts and a pump station. Part of the work had been done in
non-compliance of the original permit and entailed the construction of approximately 700 feet of
new levee section, thus negating the function of approximately 1,400 feet of the original levee. The
new i700-foot levee section has been constructed along the wetland - non-wetland interface while
the original 11,400-foot levee has been degraded to natural elevation. Removal of the original levee
will return the area once enclosed behind the levee back to an open forested system with unimpeded
hydrology and no habitat fragmentation. The new 1700-foot levee section has been constructed to
the same elevation as originally permitted, +7.0 NGVD. Approximately 0.32 of an acre of wetlands
were impacted as a result of the new levee section.

Most of the original levee alignment was built without a DoA permit and was processed as an
after-the-fact. From the original permit evaluation, it was determined that the least damaging
environmental alternative was to leave the levee in place and install multiple screw-gate culverts
along the levee alignment to maximize hydrologic exchange. Much of this alignment had already
been in place for decades and the areas behind the levee were functioning forested wetlands
exhibiting good quality habitat. The newly constructed levee section (i7 00 feet) and the
degradation of the old levee section (il,400 feet) appears to be a more favorable route and
environmentally preferable alternative. Our initial finding is that additional compensatory
mitigation for this action is not warranted as it constitutes a restoration of the area to natural
conditions. p
The comment period for the Department 20 days from the date of this joint public notice.
Written comments, including suggestions for modifications or objections to the proposed work,
stating reasons thereof, are being solicited from anyone having interest in this permit and/or this
WQC request and must be mailed so as to be received before or by the last day of the comment
period. Letters concerning the Corps of Engineers permit application must reference the applicant's
name and the Permit Application Nmnber, and be mailed to the Corps of Engineers at the address
above, ATTENTION: REGULATORY BRANCH. Individuals or parties may request an
extension of time in which to comment on the proposed work by Writing to the project manager or
clicking on the project managerâ€™s name on the public notice grid on the web page. Any request
must be specific and substantively supportive of the requested extension, and received by this office
prior to the end of the initial comment period. The Section Chief will review the request and the
requestor will be promptly notified of the decision to grant or deny the request. If granted, the time
extension will be continuous to the initial comment period and, inclusive of the initial corrnnent
period, will not exceed a total of 30 calendar days. Letters concerning the Water Quality
Certification must reference the applicant's name and the WQC Application number and be mailed
to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality at the address above.
The application for this proposed project is on file with the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality and may be examined during Weekdays between 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m.
Copies may be obtained upon payment of costs of reproduction.
Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts,
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will
reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit
which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its
reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be
considered including the ctunulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics,
aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values,
flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation,
water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production,
mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the
people.

The US Amiy Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and
local agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and
evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received Will be considered by the
US Army Corps of Engineers to determine Whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for
this proposal. To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species,
historic properties, Water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors
listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an
Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments
are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the overall public interest
of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed Work. The
possibility exists that the proposed Work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological,
scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State
Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed Work would neither affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as
critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the
Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would
result in the destruction or alteration of up to gf; acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red
drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a
substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final
determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review
by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed Work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable Waters, the
evaluation of the probable impacts Will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed
activity Will not violate Water quality standards Will be required from the Department of
Environmental Quality, Office of Environmental Services before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in Writing, Within the comment period specified in this notice, that a
public hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, With
particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing. You are requested to communicate the
information contained in this notice to any other parties Whom you deem likely to have interest in
the matter.
