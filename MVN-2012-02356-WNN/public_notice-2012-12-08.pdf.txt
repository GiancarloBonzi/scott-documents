Interested parties are hereby notified that a permit application has been received by the New Orleans District of the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to: [X] Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of March 3, 1899 (30 Stat. 1151; 33
U.S.C. 403); and/or [X] Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (86 Stat. 816; 33 U.S.C. 1344).
Application has also been made to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, Office of Environmental Services,
for a Water Quality Certification (WQC) in accordance with statutory authority contained in La. R.S. 30:2074(A)(3) and
provisions of Section 401 of the Clean Water Act (P.L. 95-217; 33 U.S.C. 1341).

BAYOU BOUILLON SEISMIC SURVEY IN IBERVILLE AND ST. MARTIN PARISHES

Name of Applicant: Boone Exploration, Inc., Post Office Box 8660, Huntsville, Texas 77340
Location of Work: An approximately 60 square mile area within the Atchafalaya Basin Floodway, in the Bayou
Bouillon Oil and Gas Field, within multiple sections of Townships 08 & 09 South, Ranges 08 & 09 East, approximately
20 miles east of Lafayette, Louisiana, in Iberville and St. Martin Parishes, as shown on the attached drawings.
Character of Work: Conduct drilling operations as required to install approximately 6,459 4-inch diameter by 40-feet
deep shot holes to be located at approximately 220 feet intervals along parallel transect lines spaced approximately 1,320
feet apart, and install approximately 7,433 geophone receivers located at equivalent intervals along similarly spaced
perpendicular transect lines, all to perform a 3-D seismic survey to obtain subsurface imaging for the discovery of
hydrocarbon resources. Approximately 833.21 cubic yards of native earthen material would be displaced through drilling
operations, temporarily stockpiled, and used to backfill the shot holes along with approximately 414 cubic yards of
hauled-in bentonite clay. Excess drill cuttings not used to backfill the shot holes would be scattered within a 4-feet radius
of each hole. The requirement for compensatory mitigation for adverse impacts to wetlands resulting from the proposed
project would be determined after one full growing season following completion of the project.
The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department of Environmental
Quality WQC will close 20 days from the date of this joint public notice. Written comments, including suggestions for
modifications or objections to the proposed work, stating reasons thereof, are being solicited from anyone having interest
in this permit and/or this WQC request and must be mailed, so as to be received before or by the last day of the comment
period. Letters concerning the Department of the Army permit application must reference the applicant's name and the
Permit Application Number, and be mailed to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at the address above. Similar letters
concerning the Water Quality Certification must reference the applicant's name and the WQC Application number and be
mailed to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality at the address above.
The application for this proposed project is on file with the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and
may be examined weekdays between 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Copies may be obtained upon payment of costs of
reproduction.

Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including
cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the national concern for both
protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the
proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the
proposal will be considered, including the cumulative effects thereof; among these being: conservation, economics,
aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards,
floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water
quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in
general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agencies and
officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity.
Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify,
condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered
species, historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above.
Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement
pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing
and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The possibility exists
that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistoric, or historical sites
or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
The proposed work appears to be located within an area designated by the U.S. Department of Interior as critical
habitat for the threatened Louisiana black bear (Ursus americanus luteolus). Our initial determination is that the proposed
activity, if conducted in compliance with terms and conditions of a duly authorized permit, is not likely to adversely affect
the Louisiana black bear or its critical habitat. We are requesting U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service concurrence with this
determination in accordance with applicable consultation provisions of the ESA.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery
Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or alteration of 0.0 acres of
EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action
would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final
determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination
with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of the
probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable water quality standards will
be required from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public hearing be
held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the reasons for holding a
public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties whom you deem
likely to have interest in the matter.
