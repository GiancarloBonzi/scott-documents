CONSTRUCT AND MAINTAIN A MARINE TERMINAL EXPANSION IN MISSISSIPPI RIVER
IN ST. JAMES PARISH
NAME OF APPLICANT: Convent Marine Terminal, c/o Shaw GBB, LLC, 3600 Springhill Business Park,
Suite 200, Mobile, Alabama 36808.
LOCATION OF WORK: In the Mississippi River, left descending bank, at a point 161.3 miles above Head of
Passes, in Convent, Louisiana, in St. James Parish, as shown in enclosed drawings.
CHARACTER OF WORK: This project was advertised by a public notice dated February 27, 2012. The
project design has since been modified to alleviate navigation concerns presented in response to the public
notice. The new design will require additional impacts to batture wetlands for a temporary crane pad and levee
crossing road.
Install and maintain an extension to the existing marine terminal to serve the existing adjacent facility.
The work will include installing a ship loader dock, mooring dolphins, a crane pad and an access road crossing
the levee. All proposed structures will extend no further than 513 feet channelward from the existing levee toe,
as shown on the drawings. This will require clearing, impacting approximately 0.7 acre of jurisdictional
wetlands. The applicant has proposed to purchase compensatory mitigation from a Corps approved mitigation
bank within the watershed to fulfill the mitigation requirement.

Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including
cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the national
concem for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may be
expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors
which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those
are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general enviromnental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and
wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion,
recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production,
mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of
this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to
determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision,
comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general
enviromnental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of
an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine
the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The
possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific,
prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State

Our initial finding is that the proposed Work would neither affect any species listed as endangered by the
U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and
recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-
Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or
alteration of n/a acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Gur initial
determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally
managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final detennination relative to project impacts and the need for
mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
lf the proposed Work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation
of the probable impacts Will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the
Enviromnental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable
Water quality standards Will be required from the Department of Enviromnental Quality, before a pennit is
issued.
Any person may request, in Writing, Within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public
hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, With particularity, the
reasons for holding a public hearing.
