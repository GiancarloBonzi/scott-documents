Revised Statutes 30:2074 A(3) and provisions of Section 401 of the Clean Water Act.
UNAUTHORIZED FILL, LAND RECLAMATION, BANKLINE STABALIZATION,
AND MARSH RESTORATION IN ORLEANS PARISH
NAME OF APPLICANT: CRX, LLC, c/o: Coastal Environments, Inc., 1260 Main Street, Baton
Rouge, Louisiana 70802.
LOCATION OF WORK: In Orleans Parish, located along the eastern banks of Lake Ponchartrain,
within the Lake Catherine area, Louisiana, as depicted in the attached vicinity map.
The work described below was partially completed prior to obtaining a Department of the Army
permit and was in violation of Section 301 of the Clean Water Act. All legal issues concerning the
unauthorized work have since been deferred.
CHARACTER OF WORK: Authorize unpermitted fill material as yard area for an existing residence. The
unauthorized material was existing upon acquisition of the subject property by the applicant and appeared to
have been deposited between 1998 and 2006. The applicant also proposes to excavate and redeposit fill to
perform land reclamation for personal recreational uses, deposit fill for bankline stabilization, excavate
material for access, and deposit fill for marsh restoration efforts. Proposed impacts include: (1) prior filling of
0.76 acres of jurisdictional herbaceous wetlands and 0.08 acres of jurisdictional Waters of the US for the
existing residential home site, (2) excavating approximately 0.24 acres of tidal marsh and 5.02 acres of open
water area for material and construction access, (3) filling 5.79 acres of shallow open water with rip-rap and
waterbottom material for land reclamation and bank stabilization,(4) and filling 2.18 acres of shallow open
water for marsh restoration. The applicant has proposed the on-site marsh restoration efforts as compensatory
mitigation for their project related impacts.

The applicant may be required to fully or partially restore the site to pre-project conditions if
issuance of a permit is determined to be contrary to the public interest.
The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality WQC will close 20 days from the date of this joint public notice. Written
comments, including suggestions for modifications or objections to the proposed work, stating reasons
thereof, are being solicited from anyone having interest in this permit and/or this WQC request and must
be mailed so as to be received before or by the last day of the comment period. Letters concerning the
Corps of Engineers permit application must reference the applicant's name and the Permit Application
Number, and be mailed to the Corps of Engineers at the address above, ATTENTION: REGULATORY
BRANCH. Individuals or parties may request an extension of time in which to comment on the proposed
work by writing to the project manager or clicking on the project managerâ€™s name on the public notice
grid on the web page. Any request must be specific and substantively supportive of the requested
extension, and received by this office prior to the end of the initial comment period. The Section Chief
will review the request and the requestor will be promptly notified of the decision to grant or deny the
request. If granted, the time extension will be continuous to the initial comment period and, inclusive of
the initial comment period, will not exceed a total of 30 calendar days. Letters concerning the Water
Quality Certification must reference the applicant's name and the WQC Application number and be
mailed to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality at the address above.
The application for this proposed project is on file with the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality and may be examined during weekdays between 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Copies
may be obtained upon payment of costs of reproduction.
Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts,
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the
national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably
may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable
detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative
effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns,
wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use,
navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality,
energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and,
in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the
impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make
this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water
quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used
in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant
to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public
hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The
possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological,
scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State
Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as endangered
by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the
survival and recovery of any endangered species.

This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the
destruction or alteration of approximately 13.31 acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum
and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial
adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination
relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination
with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the
evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity
will not violate applicable water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental
Quality, before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a
public hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with
particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties
whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.
The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies with
and will be conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program. The
Department of the Army permit will not be issued unless the applicant received approval or a waiver of
the Coastal Use Permit (P20120341) by the Department of Natural Resources.
