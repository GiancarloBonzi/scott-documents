PO-75 LABRANCH EAST-MARSH CREATION PILOT PROJECT
IN ST. CHARLES PARISH
NAME OF APPLICANT: Crescent Soil and Water Conservation District, c/o: US Department of
Natural Resource Conservation Service, 3737 Government Street, Alexandria, Louisiana 71302.
LOCATION OF WORK: In St. Charles Parish, Sections 41-51, T11S-R9E, on the south shore of Lake
Ponchartrain, near Norco, Louisiana.
CHARACTER OF WORK: Excavate and deposit fill to construct the PO-75 East LaBranch Marsh Creation
Pilot Project in St. Charles Parish. The proposed work will include access corridors, containment dikes,
overburden areas, and dredging approximately 82,500 cubic yards of lake-bottom to be pumped into 3 cell
locations. No heavy equipment will be utilized within 50’ of the lake rim and any vegetated wetland impacts
are expected to be temporary and/or will be restored to pre-project conditions. The overall project is intended
to test the feasibility of marsh creation and an experimental sediment containment system, as it applies to
larger projects planned in the future. It is anticipated that approximately 11.6 acres of tidal marsh will be
created upon completion of the project. The applicant has proposed that the project is self mitigating for any
temporary impacts which may occur during construction.
The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality WQC will close 20 days from the date of this joint public notice. Written
comments, including suggestions for modifications or objections to the proposed work, stating reasons
thereof, are being solicited from anyone having interest in this permit and/or this WQC request and must
be mailed so as to be received before or by the last day of the comment period. Letters concerning the
Corps of Engineers permit application must reference the applicant's name and the Permit Application
Number, and be mailed to the Corps of Engineers at the address above, ATTENTION: REGULATORY

BRANCH. Individuals or parties may request an extension of time in which to comment on the proposed
work by writing to the project manager or clicking on the project manager’s name on the public notice
grid on the web page. Any request must be specific and substantively supportive of the requested
extension, and received by this office prior to the end of the initial comment period. The Section Chief
will review the request and the requestor will be promptly notified of the decision to grant or deny the
request. If granted, the time extension will be continuous to the initial comment period and, inclusive of
the initial comment period, will not exceed a total of 30 calendar days. Letters concerning the Water
Quality Certification must reference the applicant's name and the WQC Application number and be
mailed to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality at the address above.
The application for this proposed project is on file with the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality and may be examined during weekdays between 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Copies
may be obtained upon payment of costs of reproduction.
Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts,
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the
national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably
may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable
detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative
effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns,
wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use,
navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality,
energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and,
in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the
impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make
this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water
quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used
in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant
to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public
hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The
possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological,
scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State
Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as endangered
by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the
survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the
disturbance and/or alteration of approximately 26.55 acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red
drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a
substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final
determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and
coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.

If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the
evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity
will not violate applicable water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental
Quality, before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a
public hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with
particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties
whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.
The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies with
and will be conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program. The
Department of the Army permit will not be issued unless the applicant received approval or a waiver of
the Coastal Use Permit by the Department of Natural Resources.
