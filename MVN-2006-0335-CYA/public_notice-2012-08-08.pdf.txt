PROPOSED WARD 7 LEVEE
IMPROVEMENTS AND EXTENSION IN TERREBONNE PARISH
NAME OF APPLICANT: TERREBONNE PARISH CONSOLIDATED GOVERNMENT, c/o
Shaw Coastal, Inc., ATTN: Charlotte Liner, 197 Elysian Drive, Houma, Louisiana 70363.
LOCATION OF WORK: In Chauvin, Louisiana, in Terrebonne Parish, as shown on the attached
drawings.
CHARACTER OF WORK: The applicant has requested Department of the Army authorization to
conduct levee improvements to the Upper Ward 7 Levee to include a levee extension for additional
flood protection. The levee improvement portion of the project will extend from Lashbrook
Pumping Station north to St. Louis Canal and will require approximately 200,000 cubic yards of
material that will be dredged from the existing adjacent borrow canal and utilized in raising the
levee height from +8.0 feet NAVD 88 to +l0.0 feet NAVD 88. The proposed levee extension will
tie-in to the existing levee at St. Louis Canal and extend north where it will tie-in to Thompson
Road Extension. Approximately 100,000 cubic yards of material will be excavated from a proposed
borrow canal. The levee improvement portion of the project is expected to result in minimal impact
to aquatic resources with no anticipated losses of wetlands. However, the levee extension portion of
the project will result in 4.5 acres of direct impacts to wetlands and 7.0 acres of indirect impacts to
wetlands behind the levee.

2
The applicant has designed the project to avoid and minimize direct and secondary adverse
impacts to the maximtun extent practicable. Any further reduction in levee design would not meet
engineer standards and could result in safety concerns. Additional measures will be taken to
minimize secondary impacts by utilizing a silt curtain or other siltation reducing apparatus at the
perimeter of the spoil to minimize rtmoff.
The comment period for the Department of Army will close in 20 days from the date of this joint
public notice. Written comments, including suggestions for modifications or objections to the
proposed work, stating reasons thereof, are being solicited from anyone having interest in this
permit and/or this WQC request and must be mailed so as to be received before or by the last day of
the comment period. Letters concerning the Corps of Engineers permit application must reference
the applicants name and the Permit Application Number, and be mailed to the Corps of Engineers at
the address above, ATTENTION: REGULATORY BRANCH. Individuals or parties may
request an extension of time in which to comment on the proposed work by writing to the project
manager or clicking on the project managerâ€™s name on the public notice grid on the web page. Any
request must be specific and substantively supportive of the requested extension, and received by
this office prior to the end of the initial comment period. The Section Chief will review the request
and the requestor will be promptly notified of the decision to grant or deny the request. If granted,
the time extension will be continuous to the initial comment period and, inclusive of the initial
comment period, will not exceed a total of 30 calendar days. Letters concerning the Water Quality

including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will
reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit
which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its
reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be
considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics,
aesthetics, general enviromnental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values,
flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation,
water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production,
mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the
people.
The US Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and
local agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and
evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the
US Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for
this proposal. To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species,

historic properties, Water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors
listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/ or an
Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments
are also used to detennine the need for a public hearing and to determine the overall public interest
of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed Work. The
possibility exists that the proposed Work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological,
scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State
Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed Work would neither affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as
critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species.

Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would
result in the destruction or alteration of up to QQ acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red
drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action Would not have a
substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final
determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review
by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed Work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the
evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Enviromnental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed
activity will not violate water quality standards will be required from the Department of
Environmental Quality, Office of Environmental Services before a permit is issued.
