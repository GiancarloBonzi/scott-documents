Statement of SCOTT SEBASTIEN, prior owner of Fisher Bottom,
to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New Orleans District
March 7, 2012
In April 1999 my partners and I purchased several tracts of forested Wetland and up1and
inthe Atchafalaya Basin near Interstate 10, including a 700 acre parcel known as “Fisher
Bottom,” which is shown in the attached aerial photographs. We acquiiékthe property in the
name of Mallard Basin, Inc. forthe purpose of Wildlife enjoyment and hunting. The previous
owners had established a management program to reduce invasive aquatic species and maintain
healthy biodiversity. We sought to continue their approach to managing Fisher Bottom, with
regular input from state experts.

2
We contacted the Louisiana Department of Wildlife & Fisheries and invited an
experienced biologist named Robert Helm to the property to give us professional guidance in
aquatic wildlife and habitat management. He visited the property several times after we
completed the purchase to help us refine a successful wetland stewardship program based upon
the expertise of the Department of Wildlife & Fisheries.
Fisher Bottom is a shallow water body. Even during the rainy season when Fisher
Bottom reaches full pool, the water is only 2’ - 2 1/2’ deep in the middle and progressively
shallower as you move toward the perimeter. It’s more of a marshy wetland than a lake. We
learned from Wildlife & Fisheries that the shallow water is susceptible to rapidly growing
invasive aquatic species like water hyacinth, salvania, alligator weed and cutgrass. Without
active management these plants would cover the surface of the water with floating vegetation,
crowding out native aquatic species and eliminating places for waterfowl to land or feed. If left
unmanaged, the submerged bottom would accumulate a muck, or humus, of decomposing
hyacinth and salvania that would sharply reduce available dissolved oxygen in the water. Some
of this muck would float up under the surface foliage, forming a floating mat of vegetation
commonly called “floton.” Floton can slowly strangle an otherwise healthy waterbody.
Controlling these invasive species would allow more light to reach the water, preserve
higher dissolved oxygen levels (important for fish, frogs and other aquatic animals) and give
opportunities for native perennials like sedges, wild millets, and smart weed to take root. These
native seed-bearing species in turn attract waterfowl and other migratory birds as well as turkey,
deer and nutria. The presence of a range of herbivores attracts carnivores like alligators, owls,
foxes and hawks. Our goal was to create a healthier ecosystem with more open water to ensure a
variety of animal life so that the property could provide us htmting and recreational enjoyment.

3
We followed the water management guidance of Wildlife & Fisheries during the 13 years
We owned the property. Wildlife & Fisheries recommended an annual draw-down of water to
dry-out invasive aquatic plants and accumulated bottom muck, thereby controlling these
unwanted invasives and exposing the subsoil so that native plants could germinate and take hold.
The state’s experts advised us that without active intervention under a long-term management
plan, invasive species would slowly cover Fisher Bottom with a spongy expanse of floton,
making the area undesirable to most animal species and ruining its character as a healthy marsh.
At the south-east end of Fisher Bottom, where the land is lowest, an old embankment had
been put up, we believe more than 50 years ago. A wooden weir or water control structure in the
middle of the berm govemed the outflow of water from Fisher Bottom. On the advice of
Wildlife & Fisheries we replaced the old wooden weir with more easily adustable alumintun
water control structure. By removing successive panels from the improved weir we could
gradually lower the water level in Fisher Bottom at the right time each year in order to combat
undesirable aquatic species. We also installed a water pump in uplands we own on a separate
parcel along the Vlfhiskey Bay Pilot Channel to bring water from the Pilot Channel through
several thousand feet of watercourses and ditches into Fisher Bottom at its north-east side. With
this system in place we were able to raise water levels during periods of drought and we could
quickly replace water after the annual draw-down.
In practice we drained Fisher Bottom less often than once a year - about 9 times during
the 13 years of our ownership. After six weeks or so the water would largely subside in Fisher
Bottom, except for several deeper channels in the bottom contour which always retained water.
Fish, frogs and alligators used these lower pools until we restored the water level. Occasionally
we treated particularly heavy patches of invasive species with a herbicide like Rotmd-Up or 2-4-

L
4
D after the annual draw-down, on the recommendation of Wildlife & Fisheries, which regularly
uses these herbicides in sections of the Atchafalaya Basin Lmder its management. But herbicides
are expensive. To the best of my memory we used them only four to six times over the thirteen
years we owned the property.
In summary our objective at Fisher Bottom was to build on the practice of the prior
owners by using water management to combat invasive species and to encourage sufficient
biodiversity among native species to attract and support a healthy animal population. We
achieved some success in this endeavor and are now working with the new owner to share the
habitat management techniques we learned. We also put the buyer in touch with Tony Vidrine, a
biologist with the Department of Wildlife & Fisheries who worked with us after Robert Helm
died, and I understand they will continue to consult with Mr. Vidrine on proper environmental
management.
I, Scott Sebastien, declare that the foregoing statement is true and correct.
Executed on March 7 2012.
