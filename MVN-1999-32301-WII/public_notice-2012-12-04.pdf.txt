Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria

The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the
probable impacts, including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public
interest. That decision will reflect the national concern for both protection and
utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may be expected to
accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments.
All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the
cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general
environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood
hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion,
recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and
fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the
needs and welfare of the people.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal,
state, and local agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in
order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments
received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether to
make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision,
comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water
quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above.
Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an
Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.
Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the
overall public interest of the proposed activity.

No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the
proposed work. The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy
presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data.
Copies of this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic

Preservation Officer.

Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species
listed as endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any
habitat designated as critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species.

This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of
the Magnuson~Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant‘s proposal
would result in the destruction or alteration of nla acres of EFH utilized by various life
stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed
action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries
in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need
for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine

Fisheries Service.

If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable
waters, the evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines
established by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a

certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable water quality

standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, Office of
Environmental Services before a permit is issued.

Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this
notice, that a public hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public
hearings shall state, with particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing.

You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any
other parties whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.
