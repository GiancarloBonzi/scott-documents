ARTIFICIAL BREAKWATER/ ROCK REVETMENT IN ST. MARY PARISH
»
NAME OF APPLICANT: St. Mary Parish Government, 501 Main Street, 5th Floor Courthouse,
Franklin, LA 70353-6198.
LOCATION OF WORK: (29.5503l -91.52614) adjacent to the shoreline of Bayou Sale Bay and
Atchafalaya Bay at Point Chevreuil in St. Mary Parish, Louisiana.
CHARACTER OF WORK The project proposes to construct a rock revetment or an artificial
breakwater parallel to the existing shoreline at Point Chevreuil for the purpose of reducing shoreline
erosion while protecting a natural ridge and marsh. The project is proposed as two options: one is a rock
revetment and foreshore dike which will consist of excavating and temporarily stockpiling 188,000 cubic
yards of water bottom sediments to provide an access channel needed to transport 88,700 cubic yards of
rip-rap which is to be strategically placed along the shoreline of Bayou Sale Bay and Atchafalaya Bay.
The proposed work would occur approximately parallel to the mean high water shoreline, the outermost
edge to extend approximately 200 feet bayward therefrom. The access channel would be backtilled upon
project completion. Project implementation will impact 80.7 acres of waterbottoms. Option two would
1

consist of constructing a breakwater composed of 6,000 cubic yards of concrete blocks 10 feet wide,
placed to extend a maximum of 50 feet bayward from the existing bankline. This option will not require
dredging but will be facilitated through the use of a shallow draft vessel. Proj ect implementation will
impact approximately 5 acres of waterbottoms.
The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality WQC will close 20 days from the date of this joint public notice. Written
comments, including suggestions for modifications or objections to the proposed work, stating
reasons thereof, are being solicited from anyone having interest in this permit and/or this W QC
request and must be mailed so as to be received before or by the last day of the comment period.
Letters concerning the Corps of Engineers permit application must reference the applicant's name
and the Permit Application Number, and be mailed to the Corps of Engineers at the address above,
ATTENTION: REGULATORY BRANCH. Similar letters concerning the Water Quality
Certification must reference the applicant's name and the WQC Application number and be mailed to
the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality at the address above.
The application for this proposed project is on file with the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality and may be examined during weekdays between 8:00 am. and 4:30 p.m.
Copies may be obtained upon payment of costs of reproduction.
Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts,
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will
reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit
which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its
reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be
considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics,
aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values,
flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation,
water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production,
mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the
people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and
local agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and
evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit
for this proposal. To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered
species, historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest
factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or
an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments
are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the overall public interest
of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work.
The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown
2

archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to
the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed Work would neither affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as
critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the
Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would
result in the destruction or alteration of ll/A acre(s) of EFH utilized by various life stages of red
drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a
substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Ctur final
determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by
and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
lf the proposed Work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable Waters, the
evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed
activity will not violate applicable Water quality standards will be required from the Department of
Environmental Quality, Office of Environmental Services before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in Writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a
public hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state., with
particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties
whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.
