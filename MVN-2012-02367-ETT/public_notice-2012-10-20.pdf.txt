Harbors Act of March 3, 1899 (30 Stat. 1151; 33 USC 403); and/or [X] Section 404 of the Clean Water
Act (86 Stat. 816; 33 USC 1344).
Application has also been made to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, for a
Water Quality Certification (WQC) in accordance with statutory authority contained in LRS30:2047 A(3),
and provisions of Section 401 of the Clean Water Act (P.L.95-17).
DREDGE IN BARATARIA BAY TO RESTORE CAT ISLAND EAST, PLAQUEMINES PARISH,
LOUISIANA
NAME OF APPLICANT: Plaquemines Parish Government c/o Manchac Consulting Group, Inc.,
Attention: Kenneth Ferachi, 2137-A Quail Run Drive, Ste. A, Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70808.
LOCATION OF WORK: NE of Grand Isle, 20 miles south of Myrtle Grove Marina, at Latitude
29.34731, Longitude -89.86708, Barataria Bay, Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana.
EXISTING CONDITIONS: Remnants of a former 11.9 acre island (Circa 1998) exist at this location.
CHARACTER OF WORK: The applicant proposes to install a concrete breakwater/artificial reef
system, designed with gaps for tidal exchange, +3,700 linear feet by 15 feet wide by 6 feet high and
dredge, excavate, fill, and grade to restore island habitat within the +19 acre breakwater encapsulated
area. A ring berm +1,840 linear feet by 45 feet wide by 5 feet high would be constructed around a + 8
acre area that will be filled to a + 5 foot NAVD88 elevation. Another +10 acres of tidal bottoms would be
filled, outside of the ring berm and within the breakwater system, commencing at the toe of the ring berm
at the mean high water elevation (+1.70 NAVD88) and slope downward to the bottom edge of the
breakwater structures (-6 NAVD88). Approximately 170, 000 cubic yards of sediment materials (for the
project) would be harvested from a +40 acre borrow site comprised of non-vegetated tidal bottoms located
south of the restoration site. The shoreline of the restored island will be planted with native vegetation.
Barge mounted bucket dredges, bulldozers and backhoes would be used for the project. No permanent
wetland impacts are proposed and no mitigation is proposed.

Department of Environmental Quality and may be examined during weekdays between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00
p.m. Copies may be obtained upon payment of costs of reproduction
The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies with
and will be conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program. The
Department of the Army permit will not be issued unless the applicant receives approval or a waiver of
the Coastal Use Permit by the Department of Natural Resources.
Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts,
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the
national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably
may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable
detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative
effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns,
wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use,
navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality,
energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and,
in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the
impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make
this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water
quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used
in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant
to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public
hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
The Corps of Engineers is unaware of any properties listed on the National Register of Historic
Places at or near the proposed work site. The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or
destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this
notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.

3
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as endangered
by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the
survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the EFH consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery
Conservation and Management Act. The proposal would result in the destruction or alteration of
approximately +37.2 acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum, blue crab and penaeid
shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action may have a temporary adverse impact on
EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project
impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the NMFS.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the
evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity
will not violate applicable water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental
Quality, Office of Environmental Services, before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a
public hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with
particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties
whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.
