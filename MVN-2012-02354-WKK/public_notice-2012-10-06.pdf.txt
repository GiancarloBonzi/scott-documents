Application has also been made to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, Office of
Environmental Services, for a Water Quality Certification (WQC) in accordance with statutory authority

RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT IN ASSUMPTION PARISH
NAME OF APPLICANT: Steven W. Gautreau, c/o Kenneth A. Landry, Inc., Post Office Box 25, Pierre Part,
Louisiana 70339.
LOCATION OF WORK: 123 Lake Road, Pierre Part, Louisiana 70339, as shown on the attached drawings.
The work described below was partially completed prior to obtaining a Department of the Army permit
and was in violation of Section 301 of the Clean Water Act. All legal issues concerning the unauthorized work
have been deferred.

CHARACTER OF WORK: Conduct clearing and grading operations, redistribute approximately 5,000 cubic
yards of onsite earthen material and place hauled-in material consisting of 1,000 cubic yards of earth and 1,100
cubic yards of concrete rock, install and maintain approximately 225 feet of rip rap, 18-feet wide by 20-feet
long boat ramp, 28-feet wide by 24-feet long wharf with attached 6-feet wide by 70-feet long walkway, 78-feet
wide by 55-feet long house pad, 18-feet wide by 345 feet long concrete driveway, and 30-feet wide by 50-feet
long shed with attached 30-feet wide by 20-feet long roof, all to prepare a 1.37 acre site for residential
development. The rip rap is to be sited approximately parallel to the existing shoreline with attendant structures
located perpendicular to and whose outer most edge would extend 94 feet lakeward therefrom. Approximately
1.08 acres ofjurisdictional wetlands would be impacted via project implementation. The applicant agreed to
purchase appropriate mitigation credits from an approved Department of the Army mitigation bank to
compensate for all project related wetland impacts.
The applicant may be required to fully or partially restore the project site to preproject conditions, if
issuance of a permit is determined to be contrary to the overall public interest.

The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality WQC will close 20 days from the date of this joint public notice. Written comments,
including suggestions for modifications or objections to the proposed work, stating reasons thereof, are being
solicited from anyone having interest in this permit and/or this WQC request and must be mailed so as to be
received before or by the last day of the comment period. Letters concerning the Corps of Engineers permit
application must reference the applicant's name and the Permit Application Number, and be mailed to the Corps
of Engineers at the address above.
The application for this proposed project is on file with the Louisiana Department of Environmental
Quality and may be examined during weekdays between 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Copies may be obtained upon
payment of costs of reproduction.

Corns of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including
cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the national
concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may be
expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All
factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof;
among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic
properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and
accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber
production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the
people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts
ofthis proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to
determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision,
comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general
environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of
an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine
the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The
possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific,
prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State
Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as endangered by the
U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and
recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson­
Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or
alteration ofN/A acre(s) ofEFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial
determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally
managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for
mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.

-3­
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation
of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable
water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, Office of
Environmental Services before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public
hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the
reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties whom
you deem likely to have interest in the matter.
