PLAQUEMINES PARISH WESTBANK BACK LEVEE REPAIRS AND DEBRIS REMOVAL
NAME OF APPLICANT: Plaquemines Parish Government, ℅ All South Consulting Engineers,
Attn: Benjamin Elliot, 652 Papworth Avenue, Metairie, Louisiana, 70005.
LOCATION OF WORK: On and within the existing westbank back levee right of way (ROW) from
Belle Chasse to West Pointe a La Hache, in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, as shown on the enclosed drawings.
CHARACTER OF WORK: This action was granted emergency approval as part of the Hurricane Isaac
clean-up efforts under the District’s Hazardous Condition Response Activities General Permit NOD-20 on
November 1, 2012. For back levee repairs, the permittee proposed to repair and maintain twenty dewatering
levee cuts and scour locations. Hauled in fill material is to be placed in 12 inch lifts and compacted to 90% as
stated in the District’s Levee Permit Policy. In areas with minor erosion and scour: clearing, grubbing,
cleaning, and re-depositing of material is to take place on the top 12-inches of the levee. In total, 132,000 cubic
yards of material will be deposited for levee repairs and 12,000 cubic yards of material will be excavated as part
of the cleaning in minor scour areas. The debris removal area includes storm generated material on the levee
ROW and submerged debris within the drainage canal on the protected side of the levee. Mechanized land
clearing, filling, or tracking for access, staging, and/or implementation is limited to within the levee ROW. No
direct impacts to jurisdictional wetlands are anticipated with this action.
The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality WQC will close 20 days from the date of this joint public notice. Written comments,

Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including
cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the national
concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may be
expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All
factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof;
among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic
properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and
accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber
production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the
people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agencies
and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this
proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to
determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision,
comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general
environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of
an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine
the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The possibility
exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical,
historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic
Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work is Not Likely to Adversely Affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the
survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens
Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or
alteration of N/A acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial
determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally
managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for
mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of
the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable
water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, Water Quality
Certifications, before a permit is issued.

-3Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public hearing
be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the reasons for
holding a public hearing.
The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies with and will be
conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program. The Department of the
Army permit will not be issued unless the applicant received approval or a waiver of the Coastal Use Permit by
the Department of Natural Resources.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties whom you
deem likely to have interest in the matter.
