Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts,
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the
national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably
may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable
detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative
effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns,
wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use,
navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality,
energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and,
in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agencies
and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of
this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the Corps of Engineers to
determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision,
comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general
environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the
preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the
National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing
and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
The Corps of Engineers is unaware of any properties listed on the National Register of Historic
Places at or near the proposed work site. The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or
destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this
notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.

Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as threatened
or endangered by Endangered Species Act (ESA) nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the
survival and recovery of any ESA listed species. Our final determination relative to project impacts and
the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the U.S. Departments of
Interior or Commerce.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the
destruction or alteration of approximately N/A acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum
and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial
adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination
relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination
with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the
evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity
will not violate applicable water quality standards will be required from the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality, before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a
public hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with
particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties
whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.
