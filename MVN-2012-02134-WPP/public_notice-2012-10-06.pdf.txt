DESCRIPTION: Caminada Headland Beach and Dune Restoration Project- Increment II (CPRA Project
BA-45). Increment I was authorized by DNR/OCM P20111274, DNR/Consistency C20110372, USACE
MVN-2011-02539-WPP, and DEQ WQC 111006-01. This proposed project increment includes the reestablishment of the eroded headland/beach through the creation of a continuous beach and dune system
for approx. 38,500 linear feet of shoreline (±448 acres of beach and dune habitat) on the Caminada
Headland from Bayou Moreau eastward to Caminada Pass. The dune will be omitted along the
easternmost ±8,500 feet due to the presence of healthy dune habitat. Up to approx. 6,100,000 cu. yds. of
sand will be mined from the South Pelto borrow area, and then transported via hopper dredge and/or scow
barges to a proposed pump-out area (1,500’ x 1,500’). This pump-out area, located approx. 11,000 feet
offshore in the Gulf and designated as Offshore No. 3 Pump-Out Area, will allow the temporary
placement of sand mined from offshore. A conveyance corridor will be established to lay an ±11,000-foot
pipeline that will transport sand material from this offshore pump-out area to the headland and beach/dune
fill template. Four pump-out areas denoted as Lower Belle Pass, Upper Belle Pass, Offshore West, and
Offshore East, along with their respective pipeline corridors were permitted for Increment I and may be
utilized for Increment II.
LOCATION: Increment II of the Caminada Headland restoration project extends from Lat 29º 07' 36"N,
Long 90º 09' 05"W (the eastern terminus of Increment I) to Lat 29º 11' 15"N, Long 90º 03' 10"W (approx.
0.5 miles southwest of Caminada Pass). The sand will be mined from Ship Shoal, an OCS borrow area
located in South Pelto Area Blocks 13 and 14, approx. 28 nautical miles southwesterly from the center of
the Caminada Headland projects (Increments I and II). The new Ship Shoal borrow area is centered at Lat
28º 54' 47"N, Long 90º 37' 12"W. The new Offshore No. 3 Pump-Out Area is centered at Lat 29º 08'
35"N, Long 90º 03' 43"W. In Lafourche and Jefferson Parishes.
IMPACT: Approx. 305 acres of unvegetated waterbottom will be impacted at the Ship Shoal borrow site
approx. 28 nautical miles from the restoration project. If utilized by the construction contractor, approx.
52 acres of unvegetated waterbottom will be temporarily impacted at the additional offshore pump-out

-2area. If utilized by the construction contractor, the additional pipeline conveyance corridor will establish a
temporary (11,000’ x 300’; 76 acre) ROW through unvegetated waterbottom. Approx. 2.9 acres of black
mangrove habitat, approx. 436 acres of deteriorated beach habitat, and approx. 324 acres of waterbottom
will be impacted by the placement of sand to create/restore approx. 448 acres of beach and dune habitat.

Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts,
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the
national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably
may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable
detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative
effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns,
wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use,
navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality,
energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and,
in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the
impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make
this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water
quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used
in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to
the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public
hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The
possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological,
scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State
Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as endangered by
the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival
and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the
destruction or alteration of 2.9 acre(s) of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid
shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact
on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project
impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National

-4Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation
of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate
applicable water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, Office
of Water Resources before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public
hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity,
the reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties whom
you deem likely to have interest in the matter.
