SAND DREDGING IN THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER IN PLAQUEMINES PARISH
NAME OF APPLICANT: B&A Materials, Inc. c/o Gulf South Engineering and Testing, Inc.
at 2201 Aberdeen Street, Kenner, Louisiana 70062.
LOCATION OF WORK: On the right descending bank of the Mississippi River at a point
approximately eighteen miles above Head of Passes, in Bootheville, Plaquemines Parish,
Louisiana, as shown on the attached drawings.
CHARACTER OF WORK: To suction dredge sand from twelve acres of river bottom and
stockpile off-site. Approximately 191,850 cubic yards of excavated material will be pumped
across the levee in a temporary twelve-inch line and stockpiled in a non-jurisdictional area on the
protected side every two years for ten years. Noimpacts to wetlands are proposed; no
compensatory mitigation is anticipated at this time. ’
The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit will close 30 days from the
date of this public notice. Written comments, including suggestions for modifications or
objections to the proposed work, stating reasons thereof, are being solicited from anyone having
interest in this permit must be mailed so as to be received before or by the last day of the
comment period. Letters conceming the Corps of Engineers permit application must reference
the applicant's name and the Permit Application Number, and be mailed to the Corps of
Engineers at the address above, ATTENTION: REGULATORY BRANCH.
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable
impacts, including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That
decision will reflect the national concem for both protection and utilization of important
resources. The benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be
balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the
proposal will be considered including the ctunulative effects thereof; among those are

_2_
conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concems, wetlands, historic
properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation,
shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy
needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership
and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state,
and local agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider
and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered
by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny
a permit for this proposal. To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on
endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and other
public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental
Assessment and/or an Enviromnental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Enviromnental
Policy Act. Comments are also used to determinethe need for a public hearing and to determine
the overall public interest of the proposed factivity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed
work. The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown
archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being
sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
The project site provides potential habitat for the endangered pallid sturgeon
(Scaphirhynchus czlbus). The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has made a preliminary
determination that the project “may affect, but is not likely to adversely affect” the sturgeon.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any additional species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated
as critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the
Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would
result in the destruction or alteration of twelve acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red
drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a
substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our
final determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to
review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.

If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters,
the evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by
the Administrator of the Enviromnental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the
proposed activity will not violate applicable water quality standards will be required from the
Department of Enviromnental Quality before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice,
that a public hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall
state, with particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing.
The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application
complies with and will be conducted in a mamier that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal

-3_
Resources Program. The Department of the Anny permit will not be issued unless the applicant
received approval or a waiver of the Coastal Use Permit by the Department of Natural
Resources.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other
parties Whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.
