2266, Houma, Louisiana 70361
LOCATION OF WORK: on Bayou Teche, at 141 Sager Brown Road, in Baldwin, Louisiana,
in St. Mary Parish, as shown on the attached drawings.
CHARACTER OF WORK: Dredge to create a 96-foot by 32-foot boat slip, install and
maintain 328 linear feet of vinyl and steel sheetpile bulkhead, and place approximately 270 cubic
yards of dredged material as fill behind the bulkhead. The proposed work is to be located within
an area about 136 feet long parallel to the existing shoreline, with proposed dredging to extend
approximately 14 feet channelward, therefrom.
The comment period will close 15 days from the date of this public notice advertisement.
Written comments, including suggestions for modifications or objections to the proposed work,
stating reasons thereof, are being solicited from anyone having interest in this permit request.
Letters must reference the applicant's name and the notice number, be addressed and mailed to
the above address, to ATTENTION: REGULATORY BRANCH.
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable
impact including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That
decision will reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important
resources. The benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be
balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the

proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are
conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic
properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation,
shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy
needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership
and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public; federal, state, and local
agencies and officials; Indian Tribes; and other interested parties in order to consider and
evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the
Corps of Engineers to determine whether to issue, modify, condition or deny a permit for this
proposal. To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species,
historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and the other public interest
factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment
and/or Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.
Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the overall
public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed in the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed
work. The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown
archeological, scientific, prehistorical, or historical sites or data. Copies of this notice are being
sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Department of Interior nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the
survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the
Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would
result in the destruction or alteration of n/a acre(s) of EFH utilized by various life stages of red
drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a
substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final
determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review
by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters,
the evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by
the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and certification that the proposed
activity will not violate applicable water quality standards will be required from the Department
of Environmental Quality, Office of Environmental Services before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice,
that a public hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state,
with particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other
parties whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.
