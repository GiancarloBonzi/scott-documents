ERRATUM TO SPECIAL PUBLIC NOTICE
NATIONWIDE PERMIT REGIONAL CONDITIONS FOR LOUISIANA
On February 21, 2012, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) published notice in the
Federal Register announcing the reissuance of Nationwide Permits (NWPs), general conditions,
and definitions with some modifications. The NWPs became effective on March 19, 2012, and
will expire on March 18, 2017. On March 15, 2012, the Mississippi Valley Division Engineer
approved regional conditions for the NWPs in Louisiana. On March 30, 2012, the New Orleans
District issued a Special Public Notice containing these regional conditions for the NWPs in
Louisiana.
On June 1, 2012, the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources, Office of Coastal
Management (OCM) issued their coastal zone consistency determination regarding the NWPs.
The NWP regional conditions for Louisiana have been updated to reflect OCM’s coastal zone
consistency determination. The purpose of this erratum is to provide interested parties the
updated version of the regional conditions for the NWPs in Louisiana. The New Orleans District
has posted these updated regional conditions for NWPs issued in Louisiana on our Regulatory
webpage at:
http://www.mvn.usace.army.mil/ops/regulatory/reg_program.asp.
Questions regarding this matter should be directed to Mr. Stephen Pfeffer at (504) 8622227 (stephen.d.pfeffer@usace.army.mil) of the Regulatory Branch.
