The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts,
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the
national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably
may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable
detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative
effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concems,
wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use,
navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality,
energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and,
in general, the needs and welfare of the people.

this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water
quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used
