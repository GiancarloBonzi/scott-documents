DESCRIPTION: Proposed approximately 55,450 linear feet of earthen protection levee along the alignment of Reach K and Reach
L of the Morganza to the Gulf Levee System. This proposed levee system will have a base width of approximately
100'. Proposed Reach K (K-1-K-20) will widen 32,200' of an existing earthen levee, and will connect the Pointe-
Aux-Chien Tie-in Levee (currently under construction) and new levee (Reach L at L-1). Proposed Reach L: L-1-L-8
will construct 12,200' of new levee; L-8-L-14 will widen 11,050' of an existing earthen levee, and tie-in to the
existing South Lafourche Protection Levee. Two existing water control structures along Grand Bayou Canal shall
remain unmodiied, and one 30' Sector Gate is proposed at the north end of Grand Bayou Canal. Approximately
27,000 cubic yards of topsoil/dirt will be hauled in and 2,009,000 cubic yards of material will be excavated onsite
and used as till to construct this levee system. Approximately 82 acres of wetlands, 145 acres of non-wetlands, and
121 acres of waterbottoms will be impacted by the proposed work. ln addition, a portion of this project is located
on the Pointe-Aux-Chenes WMA.
