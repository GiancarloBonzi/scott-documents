SPECIAL PUBLIC NOTICE
PROPOSED TIME EXTENSION OF THE GENERAL PERMIT FOR ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE COINCIDENTAL
BOUNDARIES OF THE LOUISISANA COASTAL ZONE AND THE NEW ORLEANS DISTRICT
General permit NOD-19 was originally issued on September 24, 1982, and last expired on September 30, 2012. NOD19 has proven to be an effective method to authorize public boat launch facilities within the New Orleans District in a timely
manner without the need for a public notice and its related costs. Evaluating applications under the general permit
procedures for projects that qualify because of their minor impacts allows for better use of personnel resources, yet still
allows adequate impact review. A copy of the general permit is attached.
Application has also been made to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, Office of Environmental
Services, for a Water Quality Certification (WQC) in accordance with statutory authority contained in LRS 30:2074 A(3)
and provisions of Section 401 of the Clean Water Act.”
The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality
WQC will close 30 days from the date of this joint public notice. Written comments, including suggestions for
modifications or objections to the proposed work, stating reasons thereof, are being solicited from anyone having interest in
this permit and/or this WQC request and must be mailed so as to be received before or by the last day of the comment
period. Letters concerning the Corps of Engineers permit application must reference the applicant's name and the Permit
Application Number, and be mailed to the Corps of Engineers at the address above, ATTENTION: REGULATORY
BRANCH. Individuals or parties may request an extension of time in which to comment on the proposed work by
writing to the project manager or clicking on the project manager’s name on the public notice grid on the web page.
Any request must be specific and substantively supportive of the requested extension and received by this office
prior to the end of the initial comment period. The Section Chief will review the request and the requestor will be
promptly notified of the decision to grant or deny the request. If granted, the time extension will be continuous to
the initial comment period and, inclusive of the initial comment period, will not exceed a total of 30 calendar days.
Letters concerning the Water Quality Certification must reference the applicant's name and the WQC Application number
and be mailed to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality at the address above.
The application for this proposed project is on file with the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and may
be examined weekdays between 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Copies may be obtained upon payment of costs of reproduction.
Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including cumulative
impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the national concern for both protection and
utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be
balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered
including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental
concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation,
shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and
fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, Federal, state, and local agencies and
officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity.

Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify,
condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered
species, historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above.
Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant
to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to
determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The possibility exists
that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or
data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as endangered by the U.S.
Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and recovery of any
endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery
Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or alteration of 0.0 acre(s) of
EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action
would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final
determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with
the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of the probable
impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.
Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable water quality standards will be required from the
Department of Environmental Quality, Office of Environmental Services before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public hearing be held to
consider a time extension for this general permit. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the reasons for
holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties whom you deem likely
to have interest in the matter.
