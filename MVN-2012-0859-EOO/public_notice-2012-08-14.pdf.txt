BAYOU LAMOQUE FLOODGATE REMOVAL WITHIN THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER
NAME OF APPLICANT: Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, â„… Louisiana Coastal Protection
and Restoration Authority, Post Office Box 44027, Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70804-4027.
LOCATION OF WORK: At the north and south passages of Bayou Lamoque and adjacent to the Mississippi
River on the left descending bank, approximately 33.1 miles above Head of Passes, in Plaquemines Parish,
Louisiana, Latitude: 29.44/Longitude: -89.59455, as shown on the enclosed drawings.
CHARACTER OF WORK: Access dredging for the removal of two floodgate structures; repairing and
constructing protective dolphins and trash gates; and, replacing pedestrian access for the Bayou Lamoque
Floodgate Removal Project.
North Structure: Approximately 1,659 cubic yards of material will be dredged (0.56 acres) within the 74-foot
wide inlet and temporarily placed on the vegetated stream bank for sluice gate removal and installation of two
protective dolphins. In addition, the existing pedestrian access and trash barrier will be removed and replaced at
the structure.
South Structure: Approximately 6,539 cubic yards of material will be dredged (1.47 acres) within the 98-foot
wide inlet and temporarily placed on the northernmost stream bank for sluice gate removal. An existing
mooring dolphin will be removed and the existing trash barrier will be removed and replaced at the structure.
Project implementation will impact 1.40 acres of scrub-shrub jurisdictional wetlands and 2.03 acres of nonvegetated waterbottoms. This project is proposed to be beneficial in nature, allowing unimpeded flows from the
Mississippi River into the westernmost bayous/bays of Breton Sound. The spoil areas are a temporary impact.
After construction, spoil areas will be degraded to pre-project elevations with dredged material placed back into
the channels. The applicant has requested allowing 1-year growing season to assess mitigation impacts.

-2The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit and the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality WQC will close 30 days from the date of this joint public notice. Written comments,
including suggestions for modifications or objections to the proposed work, stating reasons thereof, are being
solicited from anyone having interest in this permit and/or this WQC request and must be mailed so as to be
received before or by the last day of the comment period. Letters concerning the Corps of Engineers permit
application must reference the applicant's name and the Permit Application Number, and be mailed to the Corps
of Engineers at the address above, ATTENTION: REGULATORY BRANCH. Similar letters concerning
the Water Quality Certification must reference the applicant's name and the WQC Application number
and be mailed to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality at the address above.
The application for this proposed project is on file with the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality
and may be examined during weekdays between 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Copies may be obtained upon
payment of costs of reproduction.
Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts, including
cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the national
concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably may be
expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors
which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those
are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and
wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion,
recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production,
mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local agencies
and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this
proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to
determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make this decision,
comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general
environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of
an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine
the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The possibility
exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical,
historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic
Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work is Not Likely to Adversely Affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the
survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens
Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or
alteration of N/A acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial
determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally
managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for
mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.

-3If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of the
probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable
water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, Water Quality
Certifications, before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public hearing
be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the reasons for
holding a public hearing.
The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies with and will be
conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program. The Department of the
Army permit will not be issued unless the applicant received approval or a waiver of the Coastal Use Permit by
the Department of Natural Resources.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties whom you
deem likely to have interest in the matter.
