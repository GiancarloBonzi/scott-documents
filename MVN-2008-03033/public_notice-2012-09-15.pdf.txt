PLAQUEMEINES PARISH, LOUISIANA
NAME OF APPLICANT: State of Louisiana, Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA)

LOCATION OF WORK: Along the right descending bank of the Mississippi River upstream of mile 27
up to mile 28 “Above the Head off Passes” and in the Empire Waterway, Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana.
EXISTING CONDITIONS: A DA permit was issued on July 25, 2011, to CPRA, to hydraulically
dredge in the Mississippi River and deliver that dredged material via pipeline along the Empire Waterway
to restore approximately 668 acres of Scofield Island. A borrow site in the Gulf of Mexico was also

approximately 2100 feet in length extending approximately 550 feet towards the river channel (from the
shoreline) located between mile 27 and mile 28 “Above the Head of Passes”. The applicant is also

The comment period for the Department of the Army Permit will close 30 days from the date of
this joint public notice. Written comments, including suggestions for modifications or objections to the
proposed work, stating reasons thereof, are being solicited from anyone having interest in this permit
modification request and must be mailed so as to be received before or by the last day of the comment
period. Letters concerning this Corps of Engineers permit modification application must reference the
applicant's name and the Permit Application Number, and be mailed to the Corps of Engineers at the
address above, ATTENTION: REGULATORY BRANCH.
The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies with
and will be conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program. The
Department of the Army permit will not be issued unless the applicant receives approval or a waiver of
the Coastal Use Permit by the Department of Natural Resources.
Water Quality Certification (WQC) was issued to CPRA by the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality, prior to issuance of the original DA permit, in accordance with statutory authority
contained in LRS30:2047 A(3), and provisions of Section 401 of the Clean Water Act (P.L.95-17).
Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts,
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the
national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably
may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable
detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative
effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns,
wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use,
navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality,
energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and,
in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the
impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make
this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water
quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used
in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant
to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public
hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
The Corps of Engineers is unaware of any properties listed on the National Register of Historic
Places at or near the proposed work site. The possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or
destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this
notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.

3
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as endangered
by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the
survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the EFH consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery
Conservation and Management Act. The proposal would result in the destruction or alteration of a
minimal amount of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum, blue crab and penaeid shrimp. Our
initial determination is that the proposed action may have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or
federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project impacts and
the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the NMFS.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the
evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity
will not violate applicable water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental
Quality, Office of Environmental Services, before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a
public hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with
particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties
whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.
