DRAINAGE IMPROVEMENTS IN LAFOURCHE PARISH
NAME OF APPLICANT: Lafourche Parish Government, P.O. Box 425, Mathews, Louisiana 70375.
DESCRIPTION: Install approximately 3,000 linear feet of subsurface drainage via installation of 48”,
54” and 60” culverts, with associated catch basins, 2,480 cubic yards of backfill, and 40 cubic yards of rip
rap for bank stabilization at the outfall location. The proposal would increase the drainage efficiency of

Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts,
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the
national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit which reasonably
may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable
detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative
effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns,
wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use,
navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality,
energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and,
in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and local
agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the
impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for this proposal. To make
this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water
quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used
in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to
the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public
hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The
possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological,
scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State
Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as endangered by
the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival
and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the
destruction or alteration of N/A acre(s) of EFH utilized by various life stages of red drum and penaeid

-3shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impacts
on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project
impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National
Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation
of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed activity will not violate
applicable water quality standards will be required from the Department of Environmental Quality, Office
of Water Resources before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public
hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the
reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the information contained in this notice to any other parties whom
you deem likely to have interest in the matter.
