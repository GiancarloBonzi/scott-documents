Attn: Tre' Wharton, 17170 Perkins Road, Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70810.
LOCATION OF WORK: In Baton Rouge, Louisiana, East Baton Rouge Parish, as shown on the

CHARACTER OF WORK: The applicant has requested a time extension to complete a
previously authorized Department of the Army pennit to clear, excavate, grade and deposit fill and
aggregate material to construct a new medical office complex (Bluebonnet Campus expansion) with
parking, drainage infrastructure, detention ponds and utilities. Approximately 154,880 cubic yards
of fill material would be utilized onsite to achieve required elevations. Work at the project site has
begun in the nonwetland areas. No new additional work is proposed. The project is situated on an
approximately 57.60-acre tract and will impact approximately 21.26 acres of wetlands.
The applicant has designed the project to avoid and minimize direct and secondary adverse impacts
to the maximum extent practicable. Any further reduction in project scope would be impracticable.
As compensation for unavoidable wetland impacts, the applicant has fulfilled its compensatory
mitigation requirements in May 2003 by purchasing the necessary wetland acreage from East
Feliciana Mitigation Area operated by Rainbeau Farms.

Corps of Engineers Permit Criteria
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impacts,
including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will
reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit
which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its
reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be
considered including the ctunulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics,
aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values,
flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation,
water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production,
mineral needs, considerations of property ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the
people.
The US Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state, and
local agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider and
evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered by the
US Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny a permit for
this proposal. To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species,
historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors
listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of an Enviromnental Assessment and/or an
Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. Comments
are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the overall public interest
of the proposed activity.

No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The
possibility exists that the proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological,
scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being sent to the State
Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed Work would neither affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as
critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the
Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicants proposal would
result in the destruction or alteration of up to n_/a acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red
drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a
substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final
detennination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review
by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the
evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed
activity will not violate Water quality standards will be required from the Department of
Environmental Quality, Office of Enviromnental Services before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a
public hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with
particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing. You are requested to communicate the
information contained in this notice to any other parties Whom you deem likely to have interest in
the matter.
