The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable
impacts, including cumulative impacts ofthe prop'ose`df activity on the public interest. That
decision will reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important
resources. The benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be
balanced against its reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the
proposal will be considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are
conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic
properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation,
shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy
needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership
and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public, federal, state,
and local agencies and officials, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties in order to consider
and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be considered
by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether to make, modify, condition, or deny
a permit for this proposal. To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on
endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and other
public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental
Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental
Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine
the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Regi.S,,ter of Historic Places are near the proposed
work. The possibility exists that the proposed workl-may damage or destroy presently unknown
archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of this notice are being
sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as
endangered by the U.S. Departments of Interior or Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated
as critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered Species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) consultation requirements of the
Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would
result in the destruction or alteration of N/A acres of EFH utilized by various life stages of red
drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a
substantial adverse impact on EFH or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our
final determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to
review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters,
the evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines establlished by
the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the
proposed activity will not violate applicable water quality standards will be required from the
Department of Environmental Quality before _a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, withiiifthe comment period specified in this notice,
that a public hearing be held to consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall
state, with particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing.

parties whom you deem likely to have interest in the matter.
