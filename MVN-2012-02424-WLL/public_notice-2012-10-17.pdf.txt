may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its reasonably foreseeable
detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the ctunulative
effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concems,
wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use,

this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water
quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used
in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant
to the National Enviromnental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the need for a public
