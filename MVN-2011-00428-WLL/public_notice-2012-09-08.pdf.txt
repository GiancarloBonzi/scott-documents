including cumulative impacts of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will
reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefit
which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its
reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be
considered including the cumulative effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics,
aesthetics, general enviromnental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and wildlife values,
flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation,

for this proposal. To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered
species, historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects, and other public interest
factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and/or
an Enviromnental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Enviromnental Policy Act. Comments
are also used to determine the need for a public hearing and to determine the overall public interest

determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by
and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed Work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable Waters, the
evaluation of the probable impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, a certification that the proposed
activity will not violate applicable Water quality standards Will be required from the Department of
