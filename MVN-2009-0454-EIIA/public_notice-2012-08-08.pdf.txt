may request an extension of time in which to comment on the proposed work by writing to the project manager or clicking on the

requested extension, and received by this office prior to the end of the initial comment period. The Section Chief will review the

continuous to the initial comment period and, inclusive ofthe initial comment period, will not exceed a total of 30 calendar days.
The decision whether to issue a permit will be based on an evaluation of the probable impact including cumulative impacts of
the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision will reflect the national concern for both protection and utilization of
important resources. The benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal must be balanced against its
reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors which may be relevant to the proposal will be considered including the cumulative
effects thereof; among those are conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties,
fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water

supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needstconsiderations of property
ownership and, in general, the needs and welfare of the people.
The Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the public; federal, state, and local agencies and officials; Indian Tribes;
and other interested parties in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of this proposed activity. Any comments received will be
considered by the Corps of Engineers to determine whether to issue, modify, condition or deny a permit for this proposal. To make
this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general environmental
effects, and the other public interest factors listed above. Comments are used in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment
and/or Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Enviromnental Policy Act. Comments are also used to determine the
need for a public hearing and to determine the overall public interest of the proposed activity.
No properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are near the proposed work. The possibility exists that the
proposed work may damage or destroy presently unknown archeological, scientific, prehistorical, historical sites, or data. Copies of
this notice are being sent to the State Archeologist and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
Our initial finding is that the proposed work would neither affect any species listed as endangered by the U.S. Departments of
Interior and Commerce, nor affect any habitat designated as critical to the survival and recovery of any endangered species.
This notice initiates the Essential Fish Habitat (EF H) consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery
Conservation and Management Act. The applicant's proposal would result in the destruction or alteration of n/a acres of EFH utilized
by various life stages of red drum and penaeid shrimp. Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a
substantial adverse impact on EF H or federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Our final determination relative to project
impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
If the proposed work involves deposits of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, the evaluation of the probable
impacts will include the application of guidelines established by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and
certification that the proposed activity will not violate applicable water quality standards will be required from the Department of
Environmental Quality, Office of Water Resources before a permit is issued.
Any person may request, in writing, within the comment period specified in this notice, that a public hearing be held to
consider this application. Requests for public hearings shall state, with particularity, the reasons for holding a public hearing.
You are requested to communicate the infonnation contained in this notice to any other parties whom you deem likely to
have interest in the matter. The applicant has certified that the proposed activity described in the application complies with and will
be conducted in a manner that is consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Resources Program. The Corps of Engineers permit will not be
issued unless the applicant has received approval or a waiver of the Coastal Use Permit by the Department of Natural Resources.
